0,0, Community Health Fund supports free glasses to the elderly   Wed 05 July 2023  ,"  Community Health Fund supports free glasses to the elderly   The Community Health Fund (CHF) provides eye examinations and glasses to elderly in Sakon Nakhon province.   On 2 June, the National Health Security Office (NHSO) Deputy Secretary-General Dr Athaporn Limpanyalers led the NHSO Office Region 8 to follow up on the outcome of CHF implementation in Song Dao Nong Daeng Municipality in Song Dao district of Sakon Nakhon.    Introduced in 2006, CHF is the NHSO’s health program that encourages local administrative organizations and municipalities in Thailand to promote good health and well-being of the people in their governing areas.   They can propose health projects related to primary care, community-based care, or health promotion and disease prevention to the NHSO and get the fund to make the projects materialize.   Engaging local governments in the health system is one of the main components of Thailand’s Universal Health Coverage. As local governments are close to communities, they can identify local health needs and design the projects that answer these needs.    In Song Dao Nong Daeng, the CHF and the municipality co-funded a health program that expand vision screening and provide free glasses to senior citizens.  The 51,600-baht program is implemented by Song Dao Community Hospital, said the municipality mayor Tong-on Pongkamsinh.   Vichan Datumma, the chief of Song Dao district, said that the program involves village health volunteers in searching for elderly having poor vision, either long- or shot-eyesight.   This survey finds 358 people urgently needed due to  vision problems trouble their daily lives.   “Having personal glasses can improve the quality of life and mental state of seniors. They can live normal lives, like watching television and walking around their houses, without needing assistance from their family members,” said Vichan.    Thevee Kesri, a 74-year-old resident of Song Dao Nong Daeng district, said that the poor eyesight c made completing daily tasks difficult. However, since receiving glasses through the CHF, she has regained a sense of normalcy and productivity.   Dr Athaporn said during his visit to the community that the elderly  are the primary focus for the NHSO as Thailand transitions to  an aged society.   Approximately one million people cross into elderly threshold of over 60 each year.   To improve their quality of life, the NHOS emphasizes the health program that provides devices and necessary items to the elderly, including glasses.    Dr Athaporn said the NHSO aims to provide free glasses to 500,000 seniors annually, with 60-million-baht allocated  to support the eye examination services and the procurement of glasses.   In addition, he said that the NHSO had engaged local governments through several programs.   One of those is the 2009-launch Provincial Rehabilitation Fund which supports local governments to provide care and assistive devices to people living with disabilities, the elderly, and patients requiring rehabilitation.    These programs are proved valuable, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic when local governments play a significant role in disease surveillance and prevention.   With the fund from the CHF, local government organizations could obtain the resources to conduct COVID-19 screening, take care of persons under self-quarantine, and pay allowances to village health volunteers who provide home care to community members under the travel restriction.           "
1,1, ​Acellular pertussis vaccines offered to pregnant women   Wed 05 July 2023  ,"   Acellular pertussis vaccines offered to pregnant women   The National Health Security Board (NHSB) approved the proposal to introduce acellular pertussis vaccines into the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS).   Pregnant women are the prime target because evidence suggests that vaccination can protect infants from pertussis.   The NHSB’s meeting on 7 June when Assoc. Prof. Dr Prasobsri Ungthavorn, a member of the National Health Security Board (NHSB) and chair of the NHSB’s sub-committee , proposed to the board members to include four new items into the UCS benefits package,   One of these benefits is acellular pertussis vaccines for women between 27 and 36 weeks of pregnancy.   Vaccinating mothers can improve the immunity of newborn babies against the disease.   Pertussis, known as whooping cough, is a highly-contagious respiratory disease caused by a bacteria called Bordetella pertussis.   It can cause pneumonia, seizures, brain damage, and death, especially for babies and children.   The Department of Diseases Control under the Ministry of Public Health reports nearly 60 cases of pertussis annually in the past five years.   The disease is found mainly in children under four years old, especially those living in rural areas where access to vaccines is restricted by geographical disparity.   The World Health Organization estimates between 20 and 40 million cases of pertussis are detected annually.    Dr Jadej Thammatacharee, the NHSO board member and secretary-general, said that approximately 110,000 doses of acellular pertussis vaccines will be offered to pregnant women this year.   This health benefit will cost the Thai government around 41 million baht. But the outcome is worthwhile as it will protect infants from the deadly disease, he said.   The vaccine will be purchased from local suppliers that develop and manufacture the vaccine and pass the set criteria, including high vaccine effectiveness and safety.   The NHSB approval is based on scientific and cost-effective studies.   Several clinical trials suggest that acellular pertussis vaccine can be offered to wider population groups, including adolescents and pregnant women, due to its safety.   It can be an alternative to the whole-cell pertussis vaccine, which is associated with higher adverse events.   In addition, the NHSB also approved the introduction of three medicines into the UCS benefits package.   They are activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) used for treating hemophilia; carglumic acid used for the treatment of hyperammonemia in patients with a deficiency in N-acetyl glutamate synthase, methylmalonic acidemia and propionic acidemia; and somatropin used for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency in infants.   “The use of these drugs will allow the UCS beneficiaries to access effective drugs, giving physicians have more choices for treating the patients,” said Dr Jadej.   “The NHSO pays close attention to the needs of UCS beneficiaries and looks for ways to answer those needs.”    "
2,2, Patients are satisfied with 'Cancer Anywhere'   Fri 23 June 2023  ,"  Patients are satisfied with 'Cancer Anywhere'   Thailand’s National Cancer Institute praises 'Cancer Anywhere' for its success in providing cancer patients with timely and quality treatment.   Launched on 1 January 2021, Cancer Anywhere is a health policy that allows cancer patients to get treatment at any hospital regardless of their registries.   Under the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS), beneficiaries’ healthcare benefits are tied to certain hospitals based on their household registries.   Changing hospitals ordinarily requiresa transfer approval document from the hospital staff — a process that could take weeks and potentially  delays treatment.   This rule is exempted under Cencer Anywhere to help health providers speed up the process of inter-hospital transfers.   This progress is made possible by technology such as online data sharing.    Dr Supakorn Pitakkarnkul, Deputy Director of the National Cancer Institute, said that the number of cancer patients in the UCS increased slightly in the past two years due to the policy.   Many may switch from state to private-run hospitals because they can choose preferable hospitals in the cities where they currently live in.   “Our evaluation finds patients receive treatment faster and express satisfaction with the policy.   Healthcare providers are also pleased with the outcomes,” said Dr Supakorn.   To facilitate the Cancer Anywhere policy, the National Cancer Institute developed a paperless inter-hospital transfer system — in which partnered hospitals share health information and medical records of the patients.    It has developed a mobile application, in which health staff can monitor queues in other hospitals, helping them identify the hospitals that can provide treatment on time.   The hospital staff also works together by assigning a “cancer coordinator” in each hospital, to coordinate inter-hospital transfer and communicate with patients about the policy and conditions.   However, Dr Supakorn said that some challenges remain.   One of those is low public’s awareness of the policy, meaning all relevant organizations must put more effort into communicating and promoting it.    Some hospitals are used to paper-based inter-hospital transfers and lack digital skills, so adapting to the electronic system is challenging.   Data sharing is still limited due to the different methodologies used for data collection in each hospital.   To tackle these challenges, Dr Supakorn said his institute will visit hospitals across the country to explain the idea and detail of Cancer Anywhere to hospital staff — hoping they will pass the message to patients.   His team will also push for a single-standard data collection system, in which every hospital applies a similar methodology of data collection and shares data across the hospitals seamlessly.   As only UCS beneficiaries are eligible for Cancer Anywhere, there is the need to push forward the policy in the other two government healthcare schemes — Social Securirty Scheme (SSS) and Civil Servant Medical benefit Scheme (CSMBS).   Around 140,000 new cancer patients emerge in Thailand each year. The most common types of cancer found among the Thai population are liver, gallbladder, lung, breast, colon, and cervical cancer.   ///////////////////////    "
3,3, Nursery and midwifery clinics improve primary care access   Fri 23 June 2023  ,"   Nursery and midwifery clinics improve primary care access          The establishment of a nursing and midwifery clinic run by the Faculty of Nursing at Mahidol University leads to people’s increasing access to primary and home care.   Assoc.Prof. DR Yajai Sitthimongkol, Dean of the faculty of Nursing, Mahidol University said that the clinic serves as an integral part of the National Health Security Office (NHSO)’s healthcare  network aiming to tackle healthcare disparity in Bangkok.   Despite Bangkok being a hub for advanced healthcare services, including tertiary and specialized hospitals, there is a big gap in its primary healthcare due to inadequate care centers.    Bangkok’s health system is driven by the private sector, many of which are not partnered with the NHSO to provide free and affordable healthcare services to beneficiaries of the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) — the Thai government’s healthcare scheme that covers 47 million people in Thailand.   Consequently,many people paying the healthcare services, including primary care, out of their pockets.     Located in Bangkok Noi district, the Faculty of Nursing’s clinic was freshly opened on 21 September last year as part of the faculty's mission to lead social changes and contribute to people’s well-being.    It aims to achieve two main goals — to increase people’s access to primary healthcare and to reduce hospital crowding.   Patients can visit the clinic to get services including general screenings, wound dressings, urinary catheterization, and physical rehabilitation. It will soon offer space for trainee nurses.   The clinic staff has organized home visits to follow up with patients discharged from Siriraj Hospital run by Nahodil University and health centers run by Bangkok Metropolitan Administration.   This helps reduce the workload of hospital staff while providing patients with access to quality and timely care.      Assoc.Prof. DR Yajai said wound dressing is the most requested service at the clinic.   The survey of clinic patients found their satisfaction with the services, especially home visits.   “The availability of clinics like this can fill the gap in healthcare access, especially for the elderly people and patients living with chronic diseases,” she said.   “They can’t access healthcare services despite being covered by the government’s healthcare scheme, because they find inconveniences in commuting to the hospitals or their health conditions don’t allow them to mobilize outside their home.”   Assoc.Prof. DR Yajai added that her faculty has more than 130 staff with varied nursing expertise, from midwifery and internal medicine to mental health.  They take turns to station at the clinic or join patients’ home visits.   But the challenge remains. Many patients are unaware of the presence of nursing and midwifery clinics, meaning there is a need to promote the clinics to the public.   In addition, the medical guidelines and regulations restrict nurses from performing tasks that overlaps with the physicians' responsibilities, limiting the number of services that can be provided at the clinics.   /////////////////////////         "
4,4, National Health Security Office of Thailand Collaborates to Organize Continuing Professional Development Forum   Wed 14 June 2023  ,"          National Health Security Office of Thailand Collaborates to Organize Continuing Professional Development Forum  [Bangkok, Thailand] - The National Health Security Office (NHSO) of Thailand has joined hands with various partners to organize the Continuing Professional Development (CPD) Forum, a significant event aimed at enhancing the skills and knowledge of healthcare professionals.  The forum, held from June 6th to June 9th, is a collaborative effort between Thailand and international organizations, Japan, Vietnam, and Laos, emphasizing the importance of continuing education in the field of healthcare.  In alignment with the Partnership Project for Global Health and Universal Health Coverage (GLO+UHC) Phase 2, the CPD Forum strives to strengthen the capacity of Thailand and other countries in the implementation of Global Health and Universal Health Coverage.  The NHSO, in coordination with the Thailand Nursing and Midwifery Council (TNMC), the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH), and the Asia Pacific Action Alliance on Human Resources for Health (AAAH), has played a pivotal role in organizing this significant event.  The CPD Forum aims to facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration among healthcare professionals by focusing on the development of the CPD system, particularly for nurses.  Associate Professor Dr. Suchitra Luengamornlert, President of the Thailand Nursing and Midwifery Council, emphasized that CPD will play a significant part in professional and personal development.  She further highlighted that CPD will not only contribute to improved patient outcomes but also enhance the public's confidence in the healthcare system.  During the opening ceremony on the first day, Secretary-General of NHSO Dr. Jadej delivered a compelling speech highlighting the importance of the CPD system for the health workforce.  He emphasized the need for continuous learning and professional growth to meet the evolving healthcare challenges faced by the nation.  Secretary-General Jadej's address inspired participants from Thailand and other countries to actively engage in discussions and share their experiences and expertise.  The CPD Forum features a comprehensive program, including lectures, group discussions, and visits to healthcare institutions such as the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital.  The participants, including representatives from Lao PDR, Vietnam, and Japan will engage in productive discussions to identify challenges and develop strategies to enhance the CPD system in their respective countries.  The collaboration between the NHSO and its partner organizations underscores Thailand's commitment to fostering a highly skilled and competent health workforce.  Through this forum, healthcare professionals will have the opportunity to exchange experiences, learn from one another, and contribute to the development of a robust CPD system.  The CPD Forum serves as a platform for international collaboration and knowledge sharing, furthering the goal of universal health coverage.  By emphasizing the importance of continuous professional development, Thailand and its partner organizations are paving the way for enhanced healthcare services and improved patient outcomes.  As the CPD Forum progresses, participants will continue to explore innovative solutions and draft action plans that address the challenges faced by their respective countries.

5,5," UCS must cover targeted drug therapy for breast cancer, a patient group says.    Tue 13 June 2023  ","  UCS must cover targeted drug therapy for breast cancer, a patient group says.    A patient group is advocating for the inclusion of targeted drug therapy for breast cancer in the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS), referencing  the clinical evidence that validates the high efficacy of this treatmentin saving patients’ lives.    On the 30th May, Thailand Breast Cancer Community (TBCC) represented by its President Orawan Owaratin met the National Health Securirty Office (NHSO) secretary-general Dr Jadej Thammatacharee at the office headquarters in the Government Complex   Commemorating His Majesty The King's 80th Birthday Anniversary, 5th December, B.E. 2550 (2007).   The group submitted a letter urging the NHSO to include targeted drug therapy for breast cancer in the UCS.   The therapy uses medicines directed at proteins in breast cancer cells and blocks their growth.  The drugs are given to patients with stage-four breast cancer — in which cancer cells have metastasized and spread to distant parts of the body, including the bones, lungs, and liver.    Some studies suggest that targeted drug therapy offers up to 80% of success rate while chemotherapy is successful only around 30%.    Free-of-charge therapy is available for beneficiaries of Civil Servant Medical Benefits Scheme (CSMBS) — covering healthcare for nearly five million government officials and their family members.   But the rest of the 65 million Thai population — covered by UCS or Social Securirty Scheme — can only access general cancer treatments, including surgery, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy.   “This disparity reflects  the inequitable access to highly-effective treatment for breast cancer.  Bringing targeted drug therapy into the UCS benefits package will indeed help the patients live longer and improve their quality of life,” said Orawan.    On the 31st of March, her group organized a public hearing with cancer patients, most of whom expressed their concern about lacking access to targeted drug therapy in the government’s healthcare schemes.     The TBBC’s Vice President Ireal Trisansri, also a patient living with breast cancer, said she had reached stage four in 2017.   She must seek targeted drug therapy from private hospitals and pay the fee out of her pocket.    “The therapy saves my life. I can live a normal life and work to support myself,” she said. “I can get the treatment because my family can financially support me.   But many patients are unable to afford the therapy and risk mortality.”   The TBBC added that the UCS has yet covered the necessary diagnosis and treatments for stage-four breast cancer — including positron emission tomography (PET) scan, computerized tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and genetic testing.   They also requested the NHSO to improve the mobile application “Cancer Everywhere” utilized for compiling  health data of cancer patients and reserving doctor appointments.   The reservation process through the application is slow due to the lack of coordination among hospitals in sharing patients’ health data, said the group.   This challenge obstructs the NHSO’s vision to use mobile technology to improve patient’s access to timely treatment.      During the meeting with the patient group, Dr Jadej said that his team will raise the group’s request to the National Drug Information subcommittee under the Ministry of Public Health.   The subcommittee plays a role in prioritizing the medicines to be included in the National Drug Information — the list of drugs provided to patients free of charge.   “The NHSO has always looked for the opportunity to add more items to the UCS benefits package, with no exception for high-cost medicines.  But we must consider the scientific evidence and cost-effectiveness.”           "
6,6, UCS beneficiaries get rehabilitation from private clinics   Tue 13 June 2023  ,"  UCS beneficiaries get rehabilitation from private clinics  The National Health Security Office (NHSO) partners with private clinics across Thailand to offer free physical rehabilitation to Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) beneficiaries.  The partnership targets patients with four types of diseases or injuries — stroke, fragility hip fracture, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury.     The NHSO secretary-general Dr Jadej Thammatacharee said that physical rehabilitation is a pivotal component  in the recovery process of patients, especially for those transitioning from the critical phase of severe injury or illness.    To restore the functions of their limbs, they require intermediate care and regular rehabilitation during the first three to six months of recovery.   However, numerous  patients experience long queues at public hospitals as rehabilitation services are in high demand.   Long-distance commuting to the hospital is another barrier that prevents patients from maintaining consistent hospital visits and increases the risks of patients developing with permanent disabilities.   To tackle these challenges, the NHSO involves private clinics in providing physical rehabilitation to UCS beneficiaries.    Nearly 60 clinics have joined the partnership since its launch in January 2021. Their locations are easily accessible, encouraging patients to revisit the clinics for regular rehabilitation sessions.    Dr Jadej said that the public hospitals overseeing the patients will contact the clinics' staff and transfer patients to their care after the patients go through the critical stage.     The NHSO sets the guideline for ensuring quality services, which assure patients that they will receive care conforming to best practice standards.   Each patient will join no more than 20 sessions of intensive rehabilitation during the early phase of recovery.  “This partnership relies on the network of public and private healthcare providers. It has benefits the patients as they can access rehabilitation conveniently,” said Dr Jadej.   “It also reduces hospital crowding and workload of hospital staff, allowing them to concentrate emergency cases.”   However, only 10% of 800 rehabilitation clinics participates in the partnership since it launched two and a half years ago.  The NHSO has extended invitations  more private clinics to participate.   The UCS covers 47 million people in Thailand.   Due to the increasing demand for healthcare services, public-private partnership is a crucial strategy to mobilize resources from the private sector into the national health security system.  //////////// "
7,7, 17 private hospitals partner with NHSO to offer patients with timely healthcare services   Fri 09 June 2023  ,"  17 private hospitals partner with NHSO to offer patients with timely healthcare services   The National Health Securirty Office (NHSO) partners with 17 private hospitals in Bangkok and its metropolitan to offer necessary healthcare services to Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) beneficiaries.   Launched on 1 April, the partnership has provided nearly 600 extra beds to the capital’s public healthcare system and increased the scheme beneficiaries' access to healthcare services in private hospitals and on time.   The healthcare services include joint and hip replacement, hemodialysis, and vascular access for patients with chronic kidney disease — patients often wait for months to get these services in public hospitals.   As the UCS administrator, the NHSO has coordinated between public and private hospitals to facilitate inter-hospital transfers for patients needing healthcare services.    The NHSO secretary-general Dr Jadej Thammatacharee said that UCS covers nearly 5.5 million people in Bangkok alone. The number of the scheme beneficiaries can be more significant if counting immigrants.   However, public hospitals in Bangkok are inadequate despite the city's enormous population. Private hospitals are crucial in filling this gap by distributing health services to different parts of the capital.   The National Health Securirty Act, instrumental in enabling Thailand to achieve comprehensive population coverage, addresses the necessity to incorporate the private sector into the scheme and pave avenues for the NHSO to partner with private hospitals to ensure people’s access to healthcare.   Since the introduction of the UCS in 2002, numerous  private hospitals have partnered with the NHSO to provide  healthcare services to UCS beneficiaries in various healthcare programs.    The recent partnership with 17 hospitals include Kluay Nam Thai Hospital, Piyavate Hospital, Bang Na I and V Hospital, Sri Sawan Hospital, Mahesak Hospital, Mitrpracha Hospital, Vibraram pak Kred Hospital, Bang Po General Hospital and Bang Phai General Hospital,   Dr Jadej said that the partnership benefits both outpatients and inpatients rather than only being confined to outpatients as was the case with previous public-private partnerships.   The private hospitals can  claim the health service fees from the NHSO directly after providing services to the UCS beneficiaries.   This reimbursement is made possible by the NHSO’s implementation of an e-claim system enabling hospital staff to enter the healthcare service data and submit the claim online.    Approximately 2,930 patients have benefited from this partnership, according to the official record updated on 26 May. Of these, 526 are inpatients and the remainder being outpatients outpatients.   Over 130 patients suffering from chronic kidney disease received vascular access with shorter waiting times, allowing them to access hemodialysis faster.   ///////////////////////    "

9,9, Thailand succeeds in developing low-cost artificial tooth roots   Fri 02 June 2023  ,"  Thailand succeeds in developing low-cost artificial tooth roots   Thai researchers have succeeded in developing low-cost artificial tooth roots, significantly reducing the cost of dental implants.   This development has allowed the Thai government to offer free treatments through its healthcare scheme.   Recently, the Department of Health under the Ministry of Public Health, the National Health Security Office (NHSO) overseeing the Universal Coverage Scheme, and the Dental Innovation Foundation under Royal Patronage co-launched a health program to increase elderly people’s access to dental implants.    This partnership is part of the Thai government’s commemoration of the sixth-cycle birthday anniversary of His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, who will turn 72 years old in 2024.   Providing Thai people with free dental implants is made possible by innovation, said Worawut Kulklaw, secretary-general of the Dental Innovation Foundation under Royal Patronage.   The researchers in his foundation collaborated with the Faculty of Dentistry at three leading universities — Chulalongkorn, Mahidol and Chiang Mai University — to develop low-cost dental roots.   They eventually succeeded. Their product was certified by global dentistry organizations — making Thailand the second country in Asia after South Korea achieved high-standard artificial tooth root development.    This success allows the Thai government to include dental implants in the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) which ensure healthcare access to 47 million people in Thailand.    Worawut said that the development of low-cost artificial roots will increase people’s access to dental implants — the treatment that improves the quality of life for people, especially the elderly who often deal with teeth loss.   Each root cost around 3,000 baht, significantly cheaper than the imported roots widely used in private dental clinics that cost between 40,000 and 50,000 baht per root.    “Usually, artificial roots must be imported from high-innovative countries like German, Switzerland, the United States and South Korea — making their cost hike up. That's why only people with the power of purchase can access dental implants,” said Worawut.   “Thailand’s success in developing artificial roots will drive down this cost, and make many people access the treatment without financial barrier.”   He added that the development of low-cost artificial roots was inspired by the speech of His majesty King Rama XI, who urged relevant sectors to improve the oral health of the elderly.      This leads the researchers to name the artificial root model as PRK, which stands for Pharam Kao or means Rama XI.    It is produced in the factory run by the Dental Innovation Foundation under Royal Patronage located in Sam Pran district in Nakhon Phatom province.    The factory can produce 100,000 roots per year, which are distributed to public hospitals under the Public Health Ministry and private clinics.   Some of them will be exported to foreign countries through government-to-government agreements.   Around 100,000 roots were provided to 50,000 UCS beneficiaries after the launch of the model.    ///////////////////////////    "
10,10, Senior citizens express their gratitude for a health program providing them with dental implants    Fri 02 June 2023  ,"   Senior citizens express their gratitude for a health program providing them with dental implants   Many elderly people say their quality of life has improved since they received dental implants under the health program to commemorate the sixth-cycle birthday anniversary of His Majesty King Rama X.   The program was launched early this year and will continue until 2024, the year that King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun will turn 72 years old.   It aims to provide elderly with access to dental implants — a high-tech solution that implants an artificial tooth with a titanium screw into the jaw.   This program is spearheaded by the Department of Health under the Ministry of Public Health, the Dental Innovation Foundation under Royal Patronage, and the National Health Security Office (NHSO).   Thongchai Rakang, a program beneficiary, said that he received dental impacts at Mae Wong Hospital in Thailand Central’s Nakhon Sawan province.   He lost most of his teeth due to his age. He couldn’t eat properly and smile confidently.   After learning about the program through a dentist at the hospital, he decided to participate in it as his life with missing teeth was in dismay.    The dentist extracted his decayed teeth and replaced them with artificial roots and false teeth. He did not pay any single baht as the program supported all costs incurred during the treatment.    Another program beneficiary, a blue-collar worker Samruay Thammuni said that he could consume food enjoyable after receiving the dental implants.   Before getting the treatment, he was often fatigued as he couldn’t chew food which means he couldn't take nutrients from his diet. This affects his productivity in the day-to-day labor work.    “The treatment is of a high standard, I would say. I haven't experiencedany trouble after receiving the dental implants from a dentist at Mae Wong Hospital.   I have regain my strength because I can eat normally with the artificial teeth,” he said.     “I suggested my wife and daughter-in-law visit the hospital for treatment as most of their teeth are missing.   Our whole family wouldn’t be able to get the treatment without the program’s support.”     Dental implants are typically expensive, with one implant  costing at least 40,000 baht. This high cost often discourages low-income people from seeking treatment despite their missing teeth.     The accessibility to the service is made possible by the health program funded by the government’s Universal Coverage Scheme, which covers 47 million people in Thailand.   Innovation also plays a part. In the past few years, some Thai companies have successfully developed  low-cost artificial roots, enabling government to procure materials used in dental implants for a large number of the elderly population.      A beneficiary Sakhon Boonyong said the program has benefited many people, especially those from low-income families.   After receiving the dental implants, she feels happier than ever as she does not need to worry about meal times anymore.           "
11,11, Primary dental care to be accessed 'everywhere'    Tue 16 May 2023  ,"            Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) beneficiaries may be able to access primary dental care at any health unit regardless of their registries soon.    Dr Athaporn Limpanyalers, Deputy Secretary-General of National Health Security Office (NHSO) which oversees the UCS, revealed that the NHSO’s working group on dental care access is working on a proposal that will allow the scheme beneficiaries to get primary oral health services at any healthcare access points.    Currently, beneficiaries can only receive dental care at the hospitals or clinics where they are registered with a condition that presents obstacles for those living far from theese facilities or those who have relocated.   As a result, many people arediscouraged from seeking primary dental care which could helps them mitigate  the risk of severe oral health problems.    Primary dental care is the services provided by general dentists that exclude dental specialties. They include tooth extraction, filling, and scaling.    Last year, the NHSO piloted a new health policy “Outpatient Everywhere” in Bangkok, which permits UCS beneficiaries to access primary care at any hospital irrespective of their registration status.   To implement thispolicy, the NHSO adopted a new reimbursement guideline that allows hospitals to claim the fees from the NHSO even though the patients do not register at the hospitals.    The movement is part of Thailand’s healthcare reforms that aim to improve timely and quality access to primary care.   It will also reduce the healthcare burden in the long run as primary care focuses on health promotion and preventive care.     Observing the launch of the Outpatient Everywhere policy, the working group on dental care access sees the opportunity to adopt a similar model for primary dental services.   Its study suggests that to implement this policy in dental services, the reimbursement system should be based on fee schedule payment, and use electronic claims to accelerate transactions.      The number of UCS beneficiaries receiving dental care increased from 3.97 million in 2016 to 4.49 million in 2019.   The top five services provided were dental extraction, scaling, filling, X-ray, and digital dentistry.    “Our data shows that people seeking oral health services increased year by year. This indicates that many people will benefit from the working group’s proposal,” said Dr Athaporn, also the chairman of the working group.   “We will continue working on a proposal to make it materialized.”    He added that many people believeoral health problems are not urgent. However neglecting them may lead to severe health conditions --- including tooth loss which can impact dietary habits and self-esteem.   Moreever, gum disease is associated with an increased risks of numerous health conditions, including heart disease, hypertension, and some types of cancer.         "
12,12, A public-private partnership helps patients receiving vascular access   Tue 16 May 2023  ,"  The National Health Security Office (NHSO) partners with four private hospitals in Bangkok and its metropolitan region to provide permanent vascular access to the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) beneficiaries.   The service is aimed at  patients suffering from end-stage renal failure, who require vascular access to start hemodialysis.    Dr Lalitaya Kongkan, the NHSO Deputy Secretary-General, said the partnership aims to increase people’s access to renal replacement therapy.   Currently, patients often face a waiting period of six and twelve months to receive vascular access at the state-run health units, due to hospital overcrowding and a shortage of surgeons.   This resource constraint forces patients to delay hemodialysis,leading to detrimental effects on their health.   To tackle this issue, the NHSO partners with four private hospitals to fill the resource gap at the state-run facilities.   Three of those are in Bangkok, which are Piyavet Hospital, Srisawan Hospital, and Inrarat Hospital. Another is Bang Na 5 Hospital in Samut Prakan province.    The patients will be contacted by the NHSO Contact Center staff, who will inform them of their eligibility to receive vascular access at one of the partnered private hospitals.   The staff will also assist in scheduling appointment date with the hospital staff. The patients can dial the Contact Cente 1330 to ask for further information.   As of 30 April, 48 patients have made appointments with private hospitals. They will not be required to pay the surgery fee, as the NHSO will reimburse hospitals for the provided services.   Dr Lalitaya said that public-private partnership is an innovation that allows people with renal disease to access treatment faster.     The goal is to ensure  all patients in Bangkok and its metropolitan will receive vascular access within the next three to four months.    “We do appreciate the participation of private hospitals in this health initiative. It will increase the chance to save people’s lives by helping them access renal replacement therapy in time and with high-quality services,” said Dr Lalitaya.     Patients with end-stage kidney disease can access affordable treatments covered by UCS — the Thai government’s healthcare scheme that ensures healthcare access to 47 million people in Thailand.   These benefits cover services and medications in all treatment stages, including temporary and permanent vascular access procedures, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents for treating anemia caused by chronic kidney disease, and immunosuppressant drugs used in patients receiving kidney transplants.    The national health security board NHSB chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Public Health, Anutin Charnvirakul had a resolution early last year, to allow patients with end-stage kidney disease to choose the methods of dialysis under the physicians’ guidance.          "
13,13, Elderly to access dental implants in commemoration of the King Rama X   Wed 10 May 2023  ,"  Department of Health under the Ministry of Public Health, the National Health Security Office (NHSO), and the Dental Innovation Foundation under Royal Patronage join hands to increase elderly people’s access to artificial teeth and dental implants.   This partnership is part of the Thai government’s commemoration of the sixth-cycle birthday anniversary of His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, who will reach the age of 72 in 2024.    Dr Suwanchai Wattanayingcharoen, Director General of the Department of Health, said that oral health problems are common among the elderly population in Thailand.   The department’s 2017 survey found that around 8.7% of the elderly lost all their permanent teeth.   Elderly people age between 60 and 74 had approximately 18 permanent teeth, which reduced to 10 when they were over 80 years old.   Teeth loss has impacted people’s quality of life and daily routines, said Dr Suwanchai.   They can’t eat properly, leading to malnutrition. Many can’t speak normally or smile confidently, affecting their mental health and social life.    Missing teeth may also lead to periodontal disease, raising risks to general health. For example, gum disease has been linked to increased risks of many health conditions, including heart disease, hypertension, and some types of cancer.    The Department of Health has collaboratedwith health networks, including the NHSO, to improve the oral health of elderly people.   One program under this effort is to expand senior citizens’ access to artificial teeth and dental implants as part of the commemoration of the sixth-cycle birthday anniversary of Thailand’s King Rama X.   A dental implant is a high-tech solution that implants an artificial tooth with a titanium screw into the jaw. This method is often used in people weaning dentures for several years and the teeth become flat with no ridges on.    Petchara Techakampuch, Chairman of the Board of the Dental Innovation Foundation Under Royal Patronage, said that the program’s launch was inspired by His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej’s speech in 2003.   In his speech, His Majesty stated concern for people with missing teeth who couldn’t enjoy food, lost happiness, and risked health problems,   urging relevant sectors to help improve the oral health of the population.    His speech prompted dentists and multi-sectoral organizations to work together to provide dental implants to the elderly under the oral care program to commemorate the king — which provided full-mouth dental implants to more than 720,000 elderly people between 2005 and 2022.   His son, King Rama X, has promised to continue his father’s effort to improve the elderly people’s oral health.    The NHSO secretary-general Dr Jadej Thammatacharee said that free and affordable artificial teeth and dental implants have been included in the benefits package of the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) — the government’s healthcare scheme covering the health of 47 million Thais.   To provide free dental implants to UCS beneficiaries, Dr Jadej said the NHSO prioritizes the elderly people needing full-mouth artificial teeth as they are most affected by missing teeth.     In commemoration of the King’s birthday, the NHSO will accelerate its effort to search for elderly people needing artificial teeth and dental implants — by promoting this health benefit to the public and encouraging children of the elderly people to take them to the dentists.    The NHSO will also procure the materials and equipment required for dental implants and distribute them to hospitals and clinics providing dental care to the UCS beneficiaries.   ////////////////////////////////        "
14,14, Consult a doctor for choosing kidney disease treatment types    Tue 02 May 2023  ," An expert urges patients with chronic kidney disease to consult doctors when choosing the types of treatment.   Since February 1 last year, the National Health Security Office (NHSO) has implemented a new policy to allow patients with chronic kidney disease to choose the types of treatment under the doctors’ guidance.    The treatment is covered by the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) overseen by the NHSO. It includes hemodialysis, home peritoneal dialysis, and automated peritoneal dialysis (APD), as well as screening tests and medicines.  President of the Nephrology Society of Thailand, said that a large number of patients have benefited from this policy as they can select the treatment that fits their lifestyle and environment.     Dr Vuddhidej Ophascharoensuk However, many patients choose the treatment based on their preferences rather than their health conditions, leading to the risk of infections and complications.   “Most of the patients performing home peritoneal dialysis want to switch to hemodialysis because they don’t want to carry the burden of doing the treatment at home,” said Dr Vuddhidej.   “But hemodialysis has a hidden costs. Patients must travel to hospitals and spend at least four hours getting the treatment. That cost them time and financial burden.”   Certain health conditions can cause patients receiving hemodialysis to experience adverse effects, especially irregular low blood pressure that threatens their life. Many of these patients must return to peritoneal dialysis unavoidably.   Dr Vuddhidej said that many patients have false beliefs that hemodialysis is better than other types of treatment even though their effectiveness is comparable.   This misunderstanding mainly caused by misinformation or patients’ limited access to information relating to the treatments.   To solve this issue, patients should consult with doctors and coordinate in making decisions on the types of treatments based on health conditions, behaviors, lifestyle, and living environment.   Dr Vuddhidej finds the misinformation also comes from advertisements that encourage patients to buy certain products, such as supplements and herbal medicines for kidney disease treatment.   These advertisements are widespread and can be seen in many forms of media, including radio ads and posters displayed on public buses and bus stations.   He emphasized that none of the supplements and herbal products can successfully treat chronic kidney diseases.   They undermine kidney function as these products force kidneys to work harder in removing unnecessary substances from the body.   The Nephrology Society of Thailand, in collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration and the Medical Council of Thailand, has tackled the misinformation by taking legal action against companies and individuals promoting false information in health product advertisements.   Diabetes and hypertension are the major risk factors for chronic kidney failure in the Thai population, as more people tend to live unhealthy lifestyles and consumption.   “It’s important to prevent kidney disease at an early age by doing engaging in exercise, selecting healthy diets, and avoiding unnecessary supplements,” said Dr Vuddhidej.    “It’s also necessary to have medical check-ups regularly to prevent kidney disease.”   ///////////          "
15,15, Access to APD enhances the lives of patients living with kidney disease   Wed 26 April 2023  ," A local hospital in Thailand’s central region,  Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya province provides patients with automated peritoneal dialysis (APD), ensuring effective treatments for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and improving the quality of patients’ lives.   The state-run Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Hospital has collaborated with the National Health Security Office (NHSO) under the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) to care for patients living with chronic kidney disease.    On 12 April, the NHSO led by its secretary-general Dr Jadej Thammatacharee visited the hospital to study its kidney disease program that treats more than 100 patients who are still alive.  APD is one of the items included in the benefits package of UCS — the government's healthcare scheme covering healthcare access to 47 million in Thailand.  It is a home therapy option for end-stage kidney disease, using a dialysis machine to deliver and drain the dialysate automatically. Patients can run the machine while they are sleeping, allowing them to have continual sleep and be ready for work the next day.    Saowalak Chaoponetong, a nephrologist and an assistant to the director of Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Hospital, said doctors will consider the patient’s medical and social conditions before providing them with APD.  Many patients performing APD are those who can’t continue with peritoneal dialysis as its effectiveness declines  due to abdominal wall defects, or those who are at risk of having complications from pulmonary edema, heart disease, and hypertension.   Some patients can’t perform peritoneal dialysis during working hours due to their responsibilities, including studies and jobs, or they are elderly people with no caregivers.  The hospital staff usually offers training and home monitoring to the patients until they are familiar with APD, the method that can reduce the risk of infection and pulmonary edema symptoms.    Forty-six patients registered with Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Hospital are using APD. The other 79 and 98 performing hemodialysis and home peritoneal dialysis, respectively. Wachara Kuiduan, 27, is among the patients performing APD since February 2021 under the hospital staff’s guidance.  Initially, he conducted home peritoneal dialysis but found it inconvenient as he had to leave his job every four hours to perform the treatment at home.    His life has become much easier after switching to APD.  “I can perform dialysis while I’m sleeping, then go back to work during the day. If I need to travel, I can carry the machine with me,” he said  Currently, around 2,500 UCS beneficiaries are treated with APD. Between 170 and 200 new patients request APD each month.  The UCS covers all crucial treatments for chronic kidney disease such as hemodialysis and home peritoneal dialysis which are the common treatments among the patients, and kidney transplants which are offered to 600 patients each year.   ////////////////////////////////          "

17,17, Mental health hotline integrated into the UCS   Tue 21 March 2023  ,"  The Ministry of Public Health, Department of Mental Health (DMH) joins hands with the National Health Security Office (NHSO) to offer Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS)’s beneficiaries access to mental health consultation via a hotline.     The number of Thais having mental health problems — especially anxiety and depression — has surged at an alarming rate in recent years.  The DMH’s survey shows more than 1.5 million people aged more than 15, or 2.2% of the Thai population, have dealt with depression.   Only 28% of them can access consultation and treatment. Many of the rest risk developing severe symptoms that can lead to other health problems and suicides.   Around 4,000 Thais end their lives each year, and many of these relate to depression.   Another survey conducted by the DMH after the COVID-19 pandemic found that depression and stress in teenagers and young adults are higher than in older Thais — putting young people at higher risk of committing suicide and self-harm actions.   Alarming suicide rates     Dr Wimonrat Wanpen, the Director of the Institute of Child and Adolescent Mental Health, revealed that the suicide rate had increased since the pandemic — from 6.4 to 7.3 per 100,000 population in pre- and post-pandemic, respectively.   Suicidal attempts and self-harm actions are highly reported in youth aged 15 to 19, with the suicide rate at 225 per 100,000 people.  Actions that lead to life ending are also observed in students aged five to 15, with the suicide rate at 41 per 100,000 people.   These rates are higher than people of working age (45 per 100,000 people).   The surge in mental health problems among Thais may cause by three factors, said Dr Wimonrat.   First, personal attitude toward life. Many young people are pessimistic and lack the skills to regulate emotions, leading to anxiety and depression when living in a highly-competitive society and pressure to pursue quick success.   Second, the surrounding environment. Many young people live in unpleasant families and communities without their own choices.    Some experience quarrels and violence in families or bullying at schools, forcing them to find ways to escape these every-day-life circumstances.    Third, economic and social aspects. External factors such as economic crises, prolonged pandemics, and high crime rates can frame people's perception toward their lives as hopeless and lacking meaning.   “These factors are sometimes out of any individual’s control,” said Dr Wimon.   “Getting mental health consultation promptly will help people cope with difficult situations and pass through the bad times. It will help them avoid suicides.”   Integrate hotline service To relieve stress and anxiety, people need channels or platforms to seek advice and support.    The DMH has launched a 1323 Mental Health Hotline, which offers 24 hour free consultation with psychologists but its capacity is limited.  However, only 15 lines are currently available due to the DMH’s limited number of psychologists.   The waiting time could span half an hour as each consultation sessions often last more than 30 minutes. The peak time, when all lines are busy, is from 5 to 9 pm.    “Some people may hang up the phone because they can't ensure the long wait, and this could lead them to decide to end their lives,” said Dr Wimonrat.   To improve access to the hotline, the DMH has partnered with the NHSO to integrate the hotline service with the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) — which oversees the health of nearly 47 million Thais.   When the hospitals detect UCS beneficiaries with mental health problems and needing consultation, the health staff will refer the patients to the hotline staff — who will then call the patients and make appointments for the phone consultation sessions.   The patients are not required to pay fees as the service is covered under the UCS benefits package.  “Increasing the entry points to psychologists is very crucial. As more people are living with mental health problems now, the entry points must be various and increased in numbers,” said Dr Wimonrat.   This not only helps more people access psychologists but also, reduces the hospital crowding that prevents patients from getting high-quality mental health support.        "
18,18, NHSO Hosts Delegations from Kenya for 2-day Study Visit   Tue 14 March 2023  ,"          The National Health Security Office (NHSO) of Thailand recently hosted a delegation from Kenya, including the Parliamentary Committee for Health of the National Assembly of Kenya and officers from the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), for a two-day study visit from March 9-10, 2023.

19,19, Free consultation for smoking cessation   Tue 07 March 2023  ,"   Free consultation for smoking cessation   Thailand National Quitline (TNQ) partners with the National Health Security Office (NHSO) to provide free smoking cessation consultation to the beneficiaries of the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS)   Jintana Unipan, TNQ director, revealed recently that the partnership included free advice for smoking cessation via the 1600 hotline.   The partnership forms a network of hospitals and TNQ.  If hospital staff find patients with smoking problems, they will be referred to TNQ whose staff will call the patients to offer consultation for smoking cessation.   Jintana said the hotline focuses on encouraging smokers to change behaviors without relying on medicines and nicotine replacement therapy.  Around 80% of smokers who dialed the hotline were those who wanted to quit smoking voluntarily.   During the first call, the hotline staff will assert the level of commitment of smokers and connect them to smoking cessation experts if they show high commitment.   The consultation will cover various topics, including the methods of smoking cessation and finding the motivation to help patients succeed in quitting smoking.   The smokers will be monitored for a year through calls or text messages.   The record shows 32% of smokers quit smoking after having regular consultations with experts.   They continued to stop smoking for at least six months since the first day they made the commitments.   Without consultations and regular monitoring, only 3% of smokers can quit smoking.   “Collaboration with the NHSO means we have more alliances. We have adequate resources to help Thai people quit smoking. But there are a small number of smokers approaching us.   Partnering with hospitals will help us identify smokers needing help,” said Jintana.   “We want to help more people quit smoking and reduce the health expenditure relating to smoking-related diseases.”   The NHSO will pay 50 baht per hotline call to TNQ.   Each UCS beneficiary can consult with experts through the hotline as many as 12 times a year.   More than nine million people globally die from smoking-related diseases each year.  One million of those die from exposure to secondhand smoke.   In Thailand, around 72,000 people die from smoking annually, causing a 220-billion-baht economic loss.  The deadly diseases include lung cancer, chronic lung disease, health disease, and stroke.   The National Statistical Office Thailand reported that the smoking rate reduced from 20.7% to 17.4% of the Thai population in 2014 and 2017.   However, people experiencing secondhand smoke have increased especially on university campuses, showing more youths start smoking.   The number of affected people increased five times, from 2.6% to 14% in 2017 and 2021             "

22,22, UCS to provide free lab tests   Mon 27 Febuary 2023  ,"  UCS to provide free lab tests   Beneficiaries of the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) can now request free laboratory tests, covering 24 items, pilot from 17 medical technology clinics partnering with the National Health Security Office (NHSO) and planning to engage and expand with more medical technology clinics and the coverage test of the program.      The NHSO secretary-general Dr Jadej Thammatacharee said the laboratory was the essential service required for medical diagnosis, patient monitoring, disease prevention, and general health assessment.  The NHSO has pushed for increasing people’s access to laboratory services outside the hospitals so that they can reduce waiting time while relieving hospital crowding.  In 2023, the NHSO started a partnership with the Medical Technology Council (MTC) to implement the “Lab Anywhere” program, in which the UCS members can get free laboratory services at medical technology clinics partnering with the NHSO.  Twenty-four items of laboratory services will be provided to UCS beneficiaries, without charging the fees to them.  Twenty-two of these are tests for patients living with chronic diseases, for which patients must have medical prescriptions to request the services.  The other two available items, which do not require medical prescriptions, are pregnancy tests (four tests a year for each woman) and fecal immunochemical tests for finding colorectal and rectal cancer in adults aged between 50 and 70 (one test every two years.) Dr Jadej said that 17 medical technology clinics had joined the Lab Anywhere program.  All of them obtain accreditation from MTC or ISO 15189 standard or pass the checklists set by the Ministry of Public Health or Royal College of Pathologists of Thailand.   UCS beneficiaries can look for a sticker printed with “Medical Technology Clinic in the National Health Security System” pasted in front of the clinics.  “Our partnership with MTC is an uplift for the UCS. We want the beneficiaries to get the best services conveniently and timely, and meet the quality and standard,” said Dr Jadej. “We are planning to engage with more medical technology clinics that will expand the coverage areas of the program.”     MCT president Dr Somchai Jeadsermanant said that the NHSO had set up a reimbursement system so that the operators of medical technology clinics can claim the service fees from the NHSO, without charging the UCS beneficiaries.  This claim system has helped people access laboratory services without concern about the fees and their financial status, he said.  The MCT is discussing with the NHSO about adding more services into the program, including cholesterol and complete blood count tests.  Dr Somchai added that the discussion also included the expansion of the Lab Anywhere program’s coverage to other government healthcare schemes such as Social Security Scheme and Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme.         "

It directly benefits our people by helping them access birth control services.”     NHSO Deputy Secretary-General Dr Athaporn Limpanyalers said that all types of birth control methods were provided to beneficiaries of the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS), the government’s healthcare scheme overseen by the NHSO.   Those include intrauterine devices, injectable contraceptives, implant contraception, and emergency pills.   The most common sexually transmitted diseases among the Thai population are gonorrhea, non-gonococcal urethritis, chancroid, venereal disease, and syphilis.   The prevalence of most diseases has declined in the last five years.  But syphilis is on the rise. In 2021, syphilis was found in 14.83 of 100,000 people, doubling from 2017 and especially in youth aged between 15 and 24.  The increasing prevalence is associated with a low condom use rate among youth.     Dr Athaporn said that the NHSO would install more free condom vending machines in areas beyond Pattaya if they show positive outcomes.   In Pattaya, three machines are located at Bali Hai Pier and Pattaya City Hospital. They are developed by Sabuy Technology company in partnership with the NHSO.   Vachirathorn Kongsuk, the company’s co-founder, said that the partnership aims to solve the challenges that obstruct Thai people from accessing condoms.   Many Thais don’t request condoms at hospitals or health centers because they feel embarrassed. The vending machines will close this gap, he said.   A user only needs to insert a Thai identification card into a machine and get free condoms right away.       “We appreciate the government agencies that pay close attention to safe sex,” said Jamrong Pangnongyang, deputy director of Service Workers in Group Foundation known as SWING Pattaya.   “But there is still the gap. For example, some sex workers don’t want to expose their identities, and there should be channels for them to get free condoms without presenting their identification cards.”   //////////////////    "
25,25, Thailand calls WHO members to endorse the UHC declaration   Fri 10 Febuary 2023  ,"  Thailand calls WHO members to endorse the UHC declaration  Thailand calls on all country members of the World Health Organization (WHO) to endorse the United Nation’s resolution on Universal Health Coverage (UHC).  The call came up during the WHO’s 152nd Executive Board Meeting held at its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland from 30 January to 7 February.  The Executive Board is composed of 34 technically qualified members elected for three-year terms.  The main functions of the board are to implement the decisions and policies of the Health Assembly, and to advise and generally facilitate its work.  UHC is one of the main agendas in the board meeting, in which the WHO sets a goal to make one billion more people benefit from universal healthcare.  Piyanart Luangwilaiwan, a UHC budget and planning specialist from the National Health Security Office, represented Thailand in calling all WHO’s country members to accelerate their effort to achieve UHC Interventioned by her.   “The COVID-19 pandemic has hampered the implementation of the UNGA [United Nations General Assembly] Political Declaration on Universal Health Coverage,”.  “This calls for an urgent need to invest in more resilient health systems focused on primary health care, with adequate and qualified health workforces to support UHC.”   The Political Declaration on UHC was adopted during the United Nations high-level meeting in 2019, in which member states recognize health as a precondition for and an indicator of social, economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable development.  Under the declaration, countries commit to achieving UHC by 2030 to scale up the global effort to build a healthier world for all.     Piyanart said that experiences in Thailand had demonstrated the crucial role of strong primary health care and UHC in responding to the pandemic.  To ensure coverage effectiveness, the country has addressed the incidence of unmet health needs in its UHC’s indicator, which measures low access to health services . “Thailand commits to fully engage in the regional consultation on unmet health need, as part of the ongoing WHO review process of health-related SDG [Sustnable Development Goal] indicators,” Interventioned by  Piyanart.        "
26,26, A book series about Thai UHC launched   Wed 01 Febuary 2023  ,"   A book series about Thai UHC launched   The National Health Secuirty Office (NHSO) launched a book series collecting Thailand’s experience toward achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC).   The book launch event was held at the side of Prince Mahidol Award Conference at Bangkok’s Centara Grand and Bangkok Convention Center on 28 January.   The event also aims for commemorating Dr. Sanguan Nitayarumphong, a visionary doctor who spearheaded Thai UHC and became the first NHSO secretary-general.    The NHSO secretary-general, Dr Jadej Thammathataree, and Prof Dr Goran Tomson, Co-Founder and Senior Adviser Swedish Institute for Global Health Transformation, Sweden were among the participants gathering at the event.    Dr Jadej said that one of the NHSO’s missions was to share knowledge and experience about UHC with the public and the international community, which is also part of Dr Sanguan’s vision.    “We’ve collected our experience and put it in English and in many forms, including printed and electronic books that everyone can access,” said Dr Jadej.   “We hope every country can move toward achieving UHC in its national context.”   The book series has five chapters: Thai UHC and overview; the role of people’s participation in universal coverage scheme, the adoption of customer rights protection, the NHSO’s operation in the COVID-19 crisis, and 10 frequently asked question about Thai UHC.   “UHC is the foundation of the health system that determines the country’s capacity to cope with the crisis. If you have UHC, you can adapt yourself and manage the crisis in appropriate ways,” said Dr Jadej.   During the event, Dr Tomson led the commemoration of Dr Sanguan and described him as “the man of vision” who had “a combination of health and heart.”     Dr Tomson collaborated with Dr Sanguan and Thai doctors in developing research that was used to back up the establishment of Thai UHC. One of those is the development of health technology assessment for social security in Thailand.   Dr Sanguan led doctors, researchers, civil society and patient groups to develop the financial model and benefits package for the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS), which currently provides access to affordable healthcare for 47 million Thais.   The UCS filled up the gap left by other healthcare schemes — Social Security Scheme which covers employees in the formal sector, and Civil Servants Medical Benefits Scheme which cover government officials and their family members.    These two schemes do not cover people in the informal sector, who account for nearly 70% of the Thai population when the UCS was introduced in 2002.    To achieve UHC, Dr Sangaun led conversations with policymakers and politicians to convince them to support UCS.    His vision led to the establishment of the NHSO, acting as a representative of health purchasers to negotiate with health providers for multi-dimensional health services — from curative and preventive to palliative care, plus medicines and vaccines.    “Sanguan was much earlier than WHO [World Health Organization] in developing UHC,” said Dr Tomson. “With Sanguan in the room, everything was possible.”   Download the book series about Thai UHC here: https://eng.nhso.go.th/view/1/Home/EN-US      "
27,27, UCS beneficiaries to get free NCDs screening tests.    Fri 20 January 2023  ,"  UCS beneficiaries to get free NCDs screening tests.   The beneficiaries of Universal Health Coverage (UCS) can get free screening tests for non-communicable diseases at pharmacies partnering with the National Health Security Office (NHSO).   The service is part of the collaboration between the NHSO, which oversees UCS, and the Pharmacy Council of Thailand (PCT) in preventing Thai people from non-communicable diseases or NCDs.   Preecha Bhandtivej, Vice President of the Pharmacy Council of Thailand (PCT) said that at least one screening test a year would be provided to each UCS beneficiary.   The test will make people aware of health conditions and risks, and their need to change behaviors for better health outcomes.    Early screening tests for non-communicable diseases will also prevent people from developing severe symptoms that lead to life-long medication or premature death, said Preecha.   Around 63% of global deaths are associated with non-communicable diseases. The rate in Thailand is higher as non-communicable diseases link to 73% of Thai people’s death.   The most common diseases are stroke, heart disease, hypertension and diabetes.   A major factor is an unhealthy lifestyle such as smoking, lacking exercise and excessive consumption of sugar, salt and fat.   The types of offering screening tests depend on people’s age.  The tests for those aged between 15 and 34 include body mass index, blood pressure, mental health, the risk from smoking, alcohol drinking and drug.    If needed, pharmacists will consult on behavioral changes or refer the customers to hospitals.   Similar screen tests are available for adults aged between 35 and 59. But they will get additional tests including the risk of having diabetes, heart disease and stroke.   Women can request free oral contraceptive pills, emergency pills and iron and folic tablets — as part of the program’s effort to promote family planning.   The pharmacies participating in this program must be those partnering with the NHSO, which can be identified by stickers printed with “My pharmacy” presented in front of the stores.   In the near future, PCT will release a mobile application that shows the locations and contacts of the pharmacies.   Preecha assured that customers could be confident that these pharmacies would provide quality services. Their stores must go through the NHSO’s inspection.    Their pharmacists must pass the training and receive certificates from PCT.   “We have trained more than 3,000 pharmacists for this program. Around 600 pharmacies around the country have joined our effort to promote the good health of Thai people,” said Preecha.   The service fees are covered by UCS under health promotion and disease prevention Sub-fund.   Pharmacies participating in the program can reimburse the consultant fees and medicine costs with the NHSO after providing the services.    In addition to this program, PCT and the NHSO co-launched another initiative that has engaged pharmacies in caring for people having 16 common diseases since last year.   It aims to improve people's access to healthcare while preventing unnecessary hospital visits, which will reduce hospital crowding.   Around 680 pharmacies have participated in the initiative so far. More than 30,000 visits were recorded.   The survey with customers found they were highly satisfied with the initiative because they didn’t need to pay for the service fees or visit the hospitals.

28,28, The UCS improves the lives of people living with knee pain   Wed 18 January 2023  ,"   The UCS improves the lives of people living with knee pain  Knee osteoarthritis is one of the common health problems among Thai elder people.   Department of Health, Ministry of Public Health, reported in 2018 that more than six million people in Thailand suffered from knee osteoarthritis, which is the primary reason for the elderly’s disabilities.  The elderly have an 80-90% chance of having the disease because their physical decline comes with age.   Laborers working in the agricultural sector or lifting heavy weights have higher risks to develop knee osteoarthritis.   Many of these risk groups, especially those in low-income households, did not get knee replacements in the past because of its high cost — between 50,000 and 70,000 baht per surgery.   The unaffordability of this treatment prevented many elder people from having a good quality of life.  They couldn’t walk and move properly, and in many cases, must rely on their families assistance.   But access to treatment has been drastically improved since the introduction of the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) in 2002.   Covering more than 47 million Thais, the UCS provides free knee replacements to its beneficiaries — many of whom are the elderly and middle-aged people.     “Most of the people receiving the surgery could return to normal life afterward,” said Dr Jadej Thammatacharee, secretary-general of the National Health Security Office (NHSO) which oversees the UCS.  The UCS benefits package covers surgery fees and artificial joints. From 2017 to 2021, approximately 9,735 surgeries were provided to patients living with knee osteoarthritis each year.   The surgeries were provided by 232 hospitals around the country.   Kasem Kantanet, 59, is one of the patients receiving knee replacement under the UCS.   Before the surgery, he suffered from knee pain for over a decade as he had worked in the paddy field for his whole life.   The symptoms became severe in 2021.   He couldn’t walk, sit and stand smoothly. His knees became deformed. He must reduce his work days from seven to three days a week, affecting his income.       Last year, he visited Chiangkam Hospital in Payao province where he received free medical consultation, diagnosis, X-ray, and medicine.  Later the physician found medications could not relieve his pain anymore and ordered surgery for one of Kasem’s knees.          “Surgery is the best solution as medications and rehabilitation could not improve his condition.  The X-ray shows his knee joints severely deteriorated,” said Dr Chawapon Chaimuang, the head of the orthopedics department at Chiangkam Hospital.  “Our hospital has three surgeons operating around 100 joint replacements each year. Two by three of these operations are funded by the UCS.”    After the surgery, Kasem was closely monitored for a week at the hospital. He visited the hospital once every one to two months for follow-up.     He nearly returned to normal life two months after the surgery. He and Dr Chawapon are planning another surgery for the remaining knee early this year.           "
29,29, New health benefits for the elderly   Mon 09 January 2023  ,"   New health benefits for the elderly   Elder beneficiaries of the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) can now access free eyeglasses, adult diapers, dentures and dental implants.    These new health benefits are part of the Thai government’s policy to promote good health and well-being of the elderly.    Dr Jadej Thammatacharee, Secretary-General of the National Health Security Office (NHSO) which oversees UCS, said that Thailand had been approaching an aged society — prompting the Thai government to issue policies and measures to improve the life quality of elder people.      There are around 18% of the Thai population, or 12 million people, aged 60 years and older. At least one million people become the elderly population each year.   The rising aged population led Ministry of Public Health to announce 2023 as “the year of Thai elderly’s health” to promote healthcare access and the well-being of senior citizens.      Taking part in this movement, the NHSO upgrade the UCS benefits by including new free items often required by elder people. Those include;   1) Eyeglasses Around 500,000 free eyeglasses, costing around 60 million baht, will be provided to elder people throughout this year.       The NHSO will collaborate with local governments which will search for the elderly having vision problems and distribute eyeglasses to them.     2) Adult diapers Free adult diapers will be provided to two groups of the elderly — the elder people with low scores (0-6 scores) in the Barthel Index for Activities of Daily Living (ADL), and those living with overflow and fecal incontinence.       Local governments will assist the NHSO in searching for elder people who require adult diapers and propose elderly care plans to the NHSO to get the fund for purchasing the items.   The fund comes from the Long-Term Care Fund, Local Health Fund and Provincial Rehabilitation Fund — the special programs under UCS aiming for engaging local governments in providing care to the elderly, people living with disabilities, and bed-ridden patients.    The NHSO targets to distribute five million adult diapers to 50,000 elder people, under a 500-million-baht budget.   3) Dentures and dental implants Covered by UCS, around 72,000 dentures and 7,200 dental implants will be provided to the elderly.   In addition to these health benefits, Dr Jadej said the elderly can access healthcare services, medicines, and medical devices under UCS. The services include high-cost treatments for cancer and heart disease and surgeries for joint replacements and cataracts.       They can also get free treatments for chronic diseases (including diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia) and health promotion and disease prevention services (including vaccines, sugar blood tests, fluoride varnish, and screening tests for heart disease and stroke.)      In 2023, UCS beneficiaries in most parts of the country can start making appointments for health promotion and disease prevention services via the Thai government’s mobile application Pao Tang.  This online appointment was piloted in Bangkok last year.    //////////////////////////////// "
30,30, NHSO and consumer groups to prevent extra medical charge    Wed 28 December 2022  ,"  NHSO and consumer groups to prevent extra medical charge  National Health Security Office (NHSO) and Thailand Consumers Council (TCC) join hands to tackle extra billing for healthcare services provided under Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS).  On December 2, both organizations co-hosted a press conference at the NHSO headquarters in Bangkok to raise awareness about extra billing among the public and health providers.    Speaking at the event, TCC secretary-general Saree Ongsomwang said that UCS ensured healthcare access to more than 47 million beneficiaries who could request free and affordable healthcare services at hospitals partnered with NHSO.  The UCS covers thousands of items that include health services, medicines, medical supplies and devices.  However, many patients have been forced to pay medical bills, said Saree, also a member of TCC’s subcommittee for health services which tackles extra billing and ensures health service quality. Among the complaints submitted to the subcommittee is a case of pregnant women who were charged 12,595 baht for admission with cervical dilatation in Antepartum period  after her primary care  transfer.   Another case is a 74-year-old disability woman who was charged 42,529 baht as the hospital staff mistakenly assumed that she was not use her primary care facility, as disability beneficiary can access his/her convenience health facility meet her need under UCS system.  Many patients were charged for emergency care, including a 72-year-old woman who was charged for emergency services even though despite the Thai government’s implementation of the Universal Coverage for Emergency Patients (UCEP) policy.  At first, she paid a medical fee as she was unaware of the policy. After she learned about it, she returned to the hospital and showed her intention to seek medical coverage under the UCEP policy.  But the hospital staff forced her to sign an agreement that stated her will to reject the scheme’s participation.   The TCC investigated the three cases and found the hospitals charged the patients for free services. They were ordered to return the money to the patients.    The NHSO deputy secretary-general Assist. Prof. Dr Yupadee Sirisinsuk said that the NHSO received 3,329 complaints relating to extra billing between 2018 and 2022, equivalent to 35.7 million baht of medical fees.  Most complaints, or 1,526 cases, were associated with health services provided at hospitals or after inter-hospital transfer.  Nearly 600 cases were relevant to health promotion and disease prevention services, 563 emergency care, 385 accident injuries, 156 health services for newborns or unemployed people, and 101 health services provided to people living with disabilities or veterans.  The top five extra-charge diseases are digestive and oral diseases, accident injuries, COVID-19, muscle and skeleton diseases, and respiratory diseases.  The top extra-charge items and services include health services, medicines, health promotion and disease prevention services, lab investigation and pathology, artificial organs, and medical devices.   “The NHSO has paid close attention to this issue. Our board members have revised the complaints case by case and set up sub-committees to resolve them,” said Yupadee, adding that patients can report extra billing via the NHSO 1330 contact center.  To solve the problem, the NHSO published a medical bill guideline to clarify which health items and services can or can’t charge under the UCS. It also issued a revised plan to prevent and monitor the extra medical charge.   ///////////////////////    "
31,31, UHC is an effective tool to achieve health for all   Mon 19 December 2022  ,"  UHC is an effective tool to achieve health for all   Universal Health Coverage (UHC) is proven to be ‘an effective tool’ to ensure universal and equitable access to health services and strengthen countries’ capacity in pandemic preparedness and response.  On December 9, Thailand commemorated ‘International Universal Health Coverage Day 2022’ and urged countries to build strong health systems to fight against public health crises, as well as to increase healthy environments and health accountability.    The commemorative event was held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Bangkok, which was participated by over a hundred Thai leaders, government officials, health experts, and civil society groups.    During the opening of the event, Don Pramudwinai, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Thailand said that Thailand had started its UHC journey in the 1970s and moved towards the full coverage of Thai population in 2002.  ""UHC has proven to be an effective tool to ensure universal and equitable access to health services. It is also an investment that pays off, especially during health crises,"" he said    Don said the Thai government had committed to making UHC responsive to new challenges — including changing disease patterns, aging society, and specific health needs and demands — and emphasizing health promotion and disease prevention to ensure the sustainability of the healthcare schemes.  Some projects are proposed and implemented to enhance Thailand's health capacity, including building an international medical hub in Phuket to serve as a training center for health personnel, a wellness center, a center of precision medicine, and a research facility for academic development at the regional level.  Minister of Public Health Sophon Mekthon said that the United Nations General Assembly adopted a political declaration of the high-level meeting on UHC in 2019, leading to global efforts to achieve UHC by 2030.  Leaders will meet again in New York in 2023 to renew commitments made in 2019. Thailand, together with Guyana, will serve as a co-facilitators of the political declaration on UHC   He added that Ministry of Public Health would focus on the people, the technology, and the expansion of service facilities in both quality and quantity in the post-pandemic era.  The adoption of new innovative healthcare services including telemedicine, telepharmacist, and other health-related issues have been added to the benefits package to ensure a healthy future for all, said Dr Sophon.   Prof. Emeritus Pawese Wasi, M.D., Honorary Member of Mahidol University Council who is behind the success of Thai UHC, said that Thailand had adopted a powerful tool called a ‘triangle that moves the mountain.’  It emphasizes the role of knowledge, social movement, and politics in solving any difficult challenge and making positive changes.  He added that the establishment of Thai UHC was associated with the ‘policy wheel,’ a policy management approach that highlights the use of evidence, political instrument, and participation in steering the policies  “Thailand is not a rich country. If Thailand can do, any country in the world can do to establish UHC,” said Dr Pawese.   Dr Olivia Nieveras, Acting WHO Representative to Thailand, said that Thai UHC can improve even more if it addressed multiple challenges, especially the quality and safe care, the aging population, and the increasing healthcare demands.  Strengthening primary care is one of the areas needed to be improved, she said. “We have the health system but it needs to be transformed into the system for health,” suggested Dr Nieveras.  “We need to talk about health promotion and disease prevention rather than treatment… We have to build a health system of wellness rather the illness.”    "

33,33, Thailand learned UHC management from Japan   Mon 28 November 2022  ,"   Thailand learned UHC management from Japan   Thai health officials and experts met with Japan’s health ministry to learn how Japan pursues the financial sustainability of the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and improves the coverage of health promotion and disease prevention services at a local level.   Led by Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, Thai delegates visited the headquarters of Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in Tokyo on November 14.   Those include Health Permanent Secretary Dr Opart Karnkawinpong, Deputy Permanent Secretary, Dr Pongkasem Khaimook, the board members of the National Health Security Office (NHSO) and its Secretary-General Dr Jadej Thammatacharee.    The visit was hosted by JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency) on the basis of the Japan and Thailand Partnership Project for Global Health and Universal Health Coverage Phase 2 (GLO+UHC2), aiming to create a platform for the two countries to exchange ideas and lessons learned to improve health security.   Thai delegates were welcomed by Dr Fukushima Yasumasa, Japan's Vice Minister for Health and Chief Medical and Global Health Officer, who presented his government's strategy to manage health finance.   He said that Japan had revised its fee schedule system, a listing of items and fees used by health insurers to pay health providers and suppliers, every two years.     The revision reflects the advancement of new medical technology and increasing cost of healthcare services.   The Japanese government sets a legal and subsidy system that ensures local governments and health insurers to provide health promotion and disease prevention services with their residents and beneficiaries.   Dr Yasumasa added that he hoped Japan and Thailand would continue the collaboration to develop the best practices and knowledge for achieving the UHC.   Anutin praised Japan for its long-term success in implementing and managing the UHC, which was introduced in the country in 1961.  ""Thailand can learn a lot from Japan and adopt its know-how, especially in the area of dealing with an aging society and future emerging diseases,"" said the public health Minister.    “We’re strongly interested in local government's role in strengthening health promotion and disease prevention.”   “Our collaboration will strengthen our role in pushing the health agenda on the global stage,” he said.   During the trip, Thai delegates visited National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies and the local government administrative office, Kanagawa prefecture and Matsuda town,  to learn how national and local governmental organizations collaborate to ensure health security and design health services that meet the local people's health demands.   The visit also showcased Japan’s progress in improving big data management and monitoring and evaluation system and establishing networks to push forward effective health policies.    In 2017, the former Public Health Minister Clinical Professor Emeritus Dr Piyasakol Sakolsatayadorn led Thai health officials to visit Japan and brought back the lessons learned from Japan to improve Thailand's health finance.         "
34,34, Strengthen primary care through pharmacies   Tue 15 November 2022  ,"  Strengthen primary care through pharmacies   The National Health Security Office (NHSO) partners with the Pharmacy Council of Thailand (PCT) and retail drug stores to expand the role of pharmacists in primary care.   The partnership, started in 2019 and will be accelerated in 2023, aims to increase people’s access to primary care by tapping the opportunity of ubiquitous private pharmacies in Thailand and turning them into entry points of care.   More than 500 pharmacies have joined this partnership, which is made eligible for beneficiaries of the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) overseen by the NHSO.   The UCS beneficiaries can request free consultations with the pharmacists at the partnered drug stores and get medicines for treating 16 common illnesses — including headache, dizziness, joint and muscle pain, fever, cough, sore throat, stomachache, constipation, dysuria, irregular leukorrhea, and skin and eye irritation.    “Pharmacists are one of the key players in the health system and can play significant roles in increasing people’s access to primary care,” said the NHSO secretary general Dr Jadej Thammatacharee.   “UCS covers more than 48 million Thais, so it’s important to engage all health professionals in increasing entry points to healthcare services, especially primary care and health promotion and diseases prevention services that maintain people’s good health and minimize their risk of developing severe symptoms.”   The pharmacy joining the partnership can claim the consultation fees and medication costs from the NHSO, which represents the health purchaser.   The payment will be made in a lump sum, 180 baht per customer visit.   To join the partnership, pharmacists at the drug stores must pass the training offered by PCT. It’s expected that 1,500 pharmacies will join this effort in the next few months.   Quality pharmacies The partnership was developed during the COVID-19 pandemic.   As hospitals were crowded with coronavirus patients, many people headed to pharmacies for common illnesses instead — amplifying the roles of pharmacies in closing the healthcare gap in the health crisis.    Preecha Bhandtivej, a pharmacist and PCT’s Vice President, said that pharmacists at the retail drug stores played significant roles in testing and treating mild-symptom COVID-19 cases.   Their roles include distributing free self-test kits to risk groups, prescribing medicine to coronavirus patients, and following up on their health conditions.    “We received good feedback from the patients who said they were cared for attentively. They also found convenience when they could access care at pharmacies nearby their home,” said Preecha.   “On the other hand, keeping them at home reduce unnecessary hospital visits and hospital crowding.”   Because of this positive outcome, the PCT has collaborated with the NHSO after the health crisis to expand the partnership — which will solve health resource constraints in the long run.   Preecha added that all pharmacies joining the partnership must go through a selection process.    They must pass the checklists of Good Pharmacy Practice (GPP) standards set by the Ministry of Public Health and register in the list of “Quality Pharmacies” meaning the pharmacies that are certified to provide care to UCS beneficiaries.   Pharmacists at the stores must pass the training and tests that guarantee their abilities to provide effective consultation and medication to customers.   After they pass the test, each pharmacy will receive a certificate and a sticker printed with “My Quality Pharmacy”, which will be attached in front of their stores.   The pharmacists would refer the patients to hospitals if their symptoms become more severe, said Preecha. Join hands with retails Boots Retail Thailand is one of the drug retail stores that have participated in the partnership with the NHSO and PCT since November 3.   Yosnuntwitch Toonkumkopphuengton, Healthcare Director of Boots Retail Thailand, said that the company ran more than 200 stores that would provide UCS beneficiaries with free consultations and medications for common illnesses.   More than 230 pharmacists have passed the training required under the partnership. They offer consultations at the counters as well as through a chat feature of Boots mobile application.   Boots have operated in Thailand for 25 years and is well known for delivering quality medicines and health products to Thai customers.   It sets a mission to make Thai people access quality health products so they will have good health and well-being.   The company’s partnership with the NHSO and PCT is in line with its mission, said Yosnuntwitch. The UCS beneficiaries must show Thai ID cards at Boots’ counters to verify their identities and registered healthcare scheme.   After consulting with pharmacists and receiving medications, pharmacists will follow up symptoms of customers within three days after their visit.   “We feel grateful that the NHSO and PCT launched this partnership as it will increase people’s access to care and medicine. They can request the services unlimited time in a year,” he said.   “We believe that the partnership will benefit more than 48 million UCS beneficiaries. Six million out of those are Bangkok residents who will be interested in this benefit.”     ////////////////////////////        "
35,35, Remote care to be piloted in Bangkok   Thu 03 November 2022  ,"   Remote care to be piloted in Bangkok   National Health Security Office (NHSO) will partner with Bangkok health and digital platform providers to pilot a remote care initiative covering 42 diseases and symptoms.   The adoption of telemedicine in Thailand has accelerated since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and is widespread after the health crisis receded.   Many health units, from state and private hospitals to community clinics, have used telemedicine for many purposes — including increasing patients’ reach out, reducing hospital crowding, and saving operational costs.   As telemedicine adoption is growing fast, the NHSO has embraced it as an opportunity to improve the health system and increase people’s access to affordable care.   In 2020, the NHSO began including telemedicine in the health benefits of the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS), the tax-funded healthcare scheme that insures more than 47 million people.   The move firstly aimed to provide effective care and monitoring to COVID-19 patients who were isolated at home and health facilities, while protecting health staff from exposure to the risk of coronavirus infection.   Soon remote care was extended to patients living with chronic diseases and demanding regular medical consultation amidst resource constraints during the pandemic.  These patient groups included those dealing with cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension.   As COVID-19 became endemic now, the focus of telemedicine has shifted to improving healthcare access rather than emergency response.   Telemedicine piloted in Bangkok Bangkok, despite its rapid urbanization and development, is Thailand’s most challenging area for expanding healthcare access.   The rate of healthcare access in the capital, especially primary health services, is lower than in other parts of the country.   The NHSO’s data shows that average outpatient visits in Bangkok are 1.7 times per person in a year, lower than the national rate of 3.4 times.   This challenge links to the aspect of Bangkok’s healthcare system that depends on the private sector.   Many private hospitals and clinics are not integrated into the government’s health system, meaning patients who visit these health units must pay medical fees from their pockets.   Ministry of Public Health’s record shows that around 2,000 private clinics are located in Bangkok, while only 300 state-run primary care units are available to serve nearly 10 million residents and migrants.   Despite this gap, Bangkok has an opportunity from its widespread internet connections and availability of digital platform providers — allowing telemedicine to fill the gap.   The NHSO is aware of this gap and opportunity. On October 1, it launched the piloted telemedicine program in Bangkok to provide remote care for patients with 42 diseases and symptoms often reported in hospitals’ outpatient wards.   Those include red eyes, osteoarthritis, food poisoning, stomachache, sore throat, back pain, flu, and sinus.     Partnership with health and platform providers Partnership with health and digital platform providers are the key to achieving the piloted telemedicine initiative, said the NHSO secretary-general, Dr Jadej Thammatatacharee.   The NHSO is recruiting health providers in Bangkok to take part in the initiative and hopes it can fully be implemented within 2023.   Health providers must obtain licenses from the Ministry of Public Health and have the capacity to integrate telemedicine into their health services. They must also be able to follow the Ministry of Public Health’s guidelines, which set criteria for ensuring the standard of remote care.   The criteria include deploying patients’ identity verification system and providing effective medical consultation sessions which usually span from 10 to 15 minutes per case.   Health providers must partner with local pharmacies that can deliver medicines to patients within 24 hours after the sessions.   Dr Jadej said that health providers should be able to deploy AMED Telehealth, a telemedicine software certified by the National Science and Technology Development Agency.   The software allows health providers to record health service data that can be used to e-claim medical fees from the NHSO.   In addition, the NHSO is partnering with digital health platform providers — Good Doctor Technology, Clicknic, Mordee, and Saluber MD developed by private clinics.   These platforms have been widely used by patients under these clinics’ care. They have the potential to be improved and expand the users in near future.   The NHSO is also discussing with Bangkok Metropolitical Administration (BMA) about implementing mobile clinics, where people can request online medical consultation when they need it.   One of the possible solutions is to make mobile clinic vehicles available and accessible, perhaps in public spaces and parking lots of petrol stations.   “Our effort to expand the use of telemedicine in Bangkok will benefit patients the most. They can access primary care without paying from their pocket,” said Dr Jadej.   “One of our goals is to prevent people from visiting hospitals, of which resources should be reserved for critical and intermediate cases.   On the other hand, access to medical consultation can also encourage people to maintain good health, which will reduce resource constraints in the health system.”   ////////////         "
36,36, Sudan delegates learned from Thai UHC   Thu 20 October 2022  ,"          Sudan delegates learned from Thai UHC  Sudan health experts joined training led by the National Health Security Office (NHSO) to learn about Thailand’s experience in managing healthcare schemes under Universal Health Coverage (UHC).  Held on October 17-21, the training was joined by nine health experts from the Republic of Sudan’s National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which has implemented a project for capacity development of national health insurance toward UHC.  It was held at the NHSO’s headquarters in the Government Complex on Bangkok’s Chaengwattana Road.  Led by the Director General of General Directorate of Health services, NHIF, Elseddig Eltayeb Wahaballa Elsamani, Sudan delegates had a chance to discuss the UHC success stories with the NHSO and Thai health experts.   The discussion focused on Thailand’s experience in managing the healthcare scheme under UHC, strategic purchasing and provider payment mechanisms, and a claim management system.  UHC in Thailand comprises three public health insurance schemes - Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme (CSMBS), Social Security Scheme (SSS), and Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) administrated by the NHSO.  UCS was introduced in 2002 along with the establishment of the NHSO as a public organization committing to creating health for all in Thailand.   It has covered healthcare for more than 47 million people. The rest of the population benefit from one of the other two governments’ healthcare schemes.  “UCS is the biggest public health insurance scheme in Thailand that ensures health security for Thais, including those who don’t have access to affordable healthcare services,” said Dr Athaporn Limpanyalers, the NHSO Deputy Secretary-General, during the opening session of the training.   “In the past 20 years, we have expanded UCS population coverage, prevented our beneficiaries from facing catastrophic health expenditures, and ensured health service coverage regardless of race, gender, or religion.”  During the training, the Thai participants gave an overview of Thailand’s health system, UCS benefit package, health technology assessment, consumer protection, monitoring and evaluation, financial risk and data management.   On the other hand, Sudan delegates discussed the progress of establishing UHC in their country and Thailand’s approaches that can be applied to their health system.   The participants also visited Saraburi Hospital in Thailand’s central Saraburi province to learn about health service delivery and claim management at a regional level.

37,37, Ayutthaya hospital showcases telemedicine adoption success   Mon 17 October 2022  ,"  Ayutthaya hospital showcases telemedicine adoption success   While the COVID-19 pandemic engulfed Thailand, new health solutions emerged to save the health system and people's lives.   Telemedicine was one of those. It has been widely adopted by medical practitioners and patients since the pandemic started.  It allows hospital staff to continue providing essential health services to patients despite the social distancing measures.   Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Hospital is one of many state health units that adopted telemedicine during the pandemic and has continued using online channels to communicate with patients until now.   The hospital staff first started using telemedicine with COVID-19 patients isolated at home. Then it has been expanded to patients coping with other diseases  including diabetes, kidney disease, and hypertension  which reduces their hospital visiting time and travel costs.          Dr Chokchai Leetochawarit, Director of Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Hospital, said that his staff had used telemedicine with patients living with diabetes type 1, kidney diseases, and mental illnesses.   Another target group is inmates, who usually can’t access medical consultation regularly.   This effort is in line with a policy given by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Public   HealthAnutin Charnvirakul, who emphasizes the need for hospitals to initiate new ways of providing health services in order to increase people’s healthcare access regardless of their financial status and geographical areas.   The NHSO’s record shows that more than 60 state hospitals nationwide have adopted telemedicine. More than 89,000 patients have used telemedicine to consult with hospital staff.   Encourage patients’ behavioral changes    “The health of patients living with diabetes can be much improved if we can monitor their conditions and encourage them to change behaviors.   This can prevent the development of severe symptoms that will eventually lead to high-cost treatment,” said Dr Saowaluck Chaoponetong, a nephrologist at Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Hospital.   “Similar to kidney failure, which is a high-cost disease. The patients' behavioral changes can improve the health of their kidneys which also means reducing the treatment cost.”   To monitor the health conditions of diabetes patients, the hospital staff arranges VDO calls with patients who must report their blood sugar levels.   The calls can be arranged regularly depending on the availability of the patients and physicians.   Having regular calls help patients better control blood sugar levels while saving them time from traveling to hospitals.  After the calls, doctors will prescribe medicines and ask hospital staff to send the medicines to the patients via post.   However, Dr Saowaluck said that doctors and patients may find some barriers while using telemedicine.   One of those is the doctors’ inability to perform medical checkups and must rely on patients’ reports, which may affect diagnostic accuracy.   Other challenges include technological inaccessibility. Some patients may have poor internet connectivity or are unable to access necessary devices such as smartphones and laptops.    Close prison’s healthcare gap    In Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Prison, there are around 6,000 inmates requiring healthcare services.   Being in incarceration means inmates have faced multiple barriers to healthcare.  Telemedicine can close this gap, said Dr Thatree Bositpichet, a family doctor at Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Hospital.   “We target two groups of inmates those living with non-communicable diseases and mental health problems,” he said.   To monitor the condition of prisoners having diabetes, prisoner health volunteers will check the blood pressure and sugar levels of inmates.   They will then send the record to doctors via Line group chat.    For those requiring kidney and liver function tests, the volunteers will collect blood samples and send them to the hospital staff.   Once the doctors read the blood results, they will prescribe the medicines which will be sent to the prison.   If inmates require medical consultation, it can be arranged online.   Access to mental healthcare      Dr Supariya Saribut, a psychiatrist at Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Hospital said that the most common mental illnesses among the inmates were schizophrenia, drug-Induced schizophrenia, and general mental problems, including depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia.   Around 40 inmates with mental health problems are currently under the hospital staff’s monitoring. They can access medical consultation via online communication channels and receive medication.   However, there is some limitation in inmates’ mental health diagnosis. Prison staff must be with the inmates during the online sessions with doctors, meaning the inmates may not feel comfortable telling their whole stories.   With lessons learned from Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Hospital, telemedicine has become important in increasing people’s healthcare access, especially those in marginalized groups.   Doctors must assess the readiness of patients for telemedicine adoption. Patients must have stable health conditions and have accessibility to the internet and communication devices.    "
38,38, Pharmacies vital to primary care   Tue 11 October 2022  ,"  Pharmacies vital to primary care   Pharmacies play a vital role in primary care by improving people’s access to medicines and preliminary medical consultations.   Being aware of pharmacies’ importance, the National Health Security Office (NHSO), the Pharmacy Council of Thailand and the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) have recently launched the “Pharmacy for common illness” initiative, aiming to increase people’s access to primary care.   In partnership with the NHSO, these pharmacies have provided free consultations and medicines to the beneficiaries of the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS).   The NHSO, which oversees the UCS, covers the cost incurred during the consultations.   “Most people with minor illnesses will likely visit pharmacies, instead of hospitals. Therefore, pharmacies play a vital role as the health units caring for patients at the frontline,” said the NHSO secretary-general Dr Jadej Thammatacharee.    “Pharmacies are very close to people. They mushroom across the city. Because pharmacies are easily accessible by general people, the NHSO has involved them in the health system.” Currently, more than 200 pharmacies in Bangkok partnering with the NHSO.   They provide medicines and consultations for 16 symptoms and diseases headache, dizziness, pain in joints, muscle pain, fever, cough, sore throat, stomachache, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, vaginal discharge, skin rash/lesion, wound, eye, and ear disorder.   Some pharmacies also provide customers with free condoms and oral contraceptive pills to prevent sexually transmitted diseases.    Dr Jadej said that the NHSO will cover more items and services for partnered pharmacies in the 2023 fiscal year.   These include emergency contraception, pregnancy test, folic supplementary, mental health consultation, and screening for health risk factors.    Tavida Kamolvej, Deputy BMAGovernor, said that pharmacies could fill up the gap in primary care access.   The pharmacists can collaborate with health staff in state health centers and private clinics to provide people with care, she said.   Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) runs 69 health centers and 73 subsidiary clinics located across the capital. More than 500 private clinics and pharmacies have partnered with the NHSO.    “All these primary care units in combine can provide Bangkok people with adequate care,” said Tavida.   “The BMA and the NHSO have collaborated in expanding people’s access to primary healthcare. In the future, we will run mobile clinics with telemedicine services in areas lacking access to health units. Bangkok residents can consult doctors online and have medical checkups.”    Pharma Store on Ratchayothin Street is one of many pharmacies that has joined the primary care network of the NHSO.   Parichat Thammarati, a pharmacist at the store, said that her customers could request initial diagnoses and consultations for 16 symptoms and diseases, which are commonly found in her customers.   “We provide the patient's medicines and follow up their symptoms three days after visiting the pharmacy. The NHSO then reimburses the medicine cost for us,” she said.   “Having pharmacies act as the primary care units help people access healthcare effectively while reducing hospital crowding.       "
39,39, New UCS benefits in 2023   Fri 07 October 2022  ,"  New UCS benefits in 2023   The National Health Security Office (NHSO) reveals new health benefits added to the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) in the 2023 fiscal year.   Starting from October 1, many medical services and items will be available for UCS beneficiaries.   These benefits include:     Treatment for persistent pulmonary hypertension in newborns (Number of target patients is 320)      Vital pulp therapy (56,300 patients)      Dental implants (15,200 patients)      Quality-guarantee emergency care admission in state hospitals (53,184 patients)      Adult diapers (48,554 adults)      Pre-exposure prophylaxis for 27,000 HIV-risked persons      14 types of high-cost drugs for 9,634 patients with rare diseases      Immediate care (30,283 patients)      Treatment for poisoning (7,598 patients)      Primary care, including physical therapy, dental and home care, which the NHSO outreach target is at least 2,002,295beneficiaries)      The NHSO also added new benefits relating to health promotion and disease prevention, such as:     Screening for hepatitis B in pregnant women      Screening for thalassemia in pregnant women and their partners      Screening for syphilis in pregnant women and their partners      Smoking cessation hotline      Mental health hotline      Testing risk factors for heart disease and stroke      Screening for cancer      Screening for inherited metabolic disorder in newborns, using tandem mass spectrometry device.      Screening for tuberculosis in high-risk groups.      BRCA1/BRCA2 genetic testing in patients with breast cancer    In addition, the NHSO has implemented the strategy to upgrade the UCS and access to healthcare. This includes:  Add Covid-19 treatment and vaccination into the UCS benefits package, resulting in the government’s annual budget allocation for health benefits relevant to the coronavirus.        Push forward the increasing access to medications, including adding more drugs for cancer treatment and cannabis-related drug products.      Increase access to treatment for type-two diabetes and hypertension.      Increase the distribution of the Provincial Rehabilitation Fund, which provides funding to local governments supporting projects relevant to rehabilitation and physical therapy.      Expand the target number of patients requiring knee replacement and cataract surgery.     For long-term care targeting elderly people, the NHSO has adjusted the reimbursement system to improve access to care. The adjustment includes:     Accelerate the e-claim system by proceeding with transactions for health providers in every 15 days      Allow patients living with chronic kidney disease to select the methods of care based on their preferences and needs.      Health providers can claim medical fees for dialysis fluid and erythropoietin drugs for patients with kidney disease.     The NHSO secretary-general Dr Jadej Thammatacharee said that the improvement of UCS would never stop until health for all is achieved.   Introduced in 2002, the UCS covers healthcare for more than 47 million Thais who can access medical services regardless of their financial status.   The UCS is one of the three Thai government healthcare schemes that in combination cover healthcare for 99.99% of the Thai population.   The other schemes are Social Security Scheme and Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme.

40,40, NHSO supports safe abortion   Tue 04 October 2022  ," NHSO supports safe abortion   National Health Security Office supports safe abortion by introducing health benefits relevant to maternal and child health into the Universal Coverage Scheme.   During the International Safe Abortion Day on September 28, the NHSO showed support for women calling for safe abortion worldwide.     The NHSO secretary-general Dr Jadej Thammatacharee said that abortion had been a sensitive issue in Thai society as it is tied to local beliefs. Many people still see abortion as a sinful act.   But in reality, many women need safe abortions due to unwanted pregnancies that can cause physical and mental health problems.   When abortion was not legalized in Thailand, he said, women were forced to seek illegal abortion services that impacted their health problems and could lead to death.   In Feb last year, Thailand started legalizing abortion for women with no more than 12 weeks of pregnancy.   Doctors may consider providing abortion to those at no more than 20 weeks of pregnancy if it doesn’t affect their health.    Since the law entered into force, the NHSO began to review the health benefits relating to maternal and child health under the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS)   the Thai government’s tax-funded healthcare benefits covering more than 47 million people.   The NHSO added safe abortion into UCS’s benefits package which includes access to medications, Misoprostol and Mifepristone, used to bring about medical abortion. Currently, 144 health units in 23 provinces provide these medications legally.   Other benefits include manual and electric vacuum aspiration, procedures that use a vacuum source to remove an embryo or fetus through the cervix.   In the 2022 fiscal year, more than 12,500 pregnant women received safe abortion services under the UCS.    In addition to safe abortion, the UCS covers health services and medications for the prevention of unwanted pregnancy, including free family planning consultancy, condoms, oral contraceptive pills, and injectable contraceptives.   Intrauterine devices and contraceptive implants are also available for UCS beneficiaries, as well as those registered under other government healthcare schemes such as Social Secuirity Scheme and Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme.    Other benefits relevant to maternal and child health include the screening test for thalassemia and Down Syndrome for newborns and children.   The NHSO has supported civil society groups, and state and private players who put efforts to prevent adolescent pregnancy through activities, including sex education and online consultancy to avoid or handle unwanted pregnancy.     The Ministry of Public Health’s  record shows that the pregnancy rate in Thai teenagers between 15 and 19 years old was 25 per 1,000 population in 2021.   The rate was 28.7 and 31 per 1,000 population in 2020 and 2019, respectively, indicating adolescent pregnancy has declined in recent years.   This may link to the roles of multi-stakeholders in preventing unwanted pregnancy and increasing access to birth control medications and devices.       "
41,41, The NHSO seeks partnerships with Bangkok private clinics      Fri 09 September 2022  ,"   The NHSO seeks partnerships with Bangkok private clinics      The National Health Security Office (NHSO) pushes for building partnerships with private clinics to increase primary care entry points in Bangkok.   Named ‘Primary Care Model 5’, the partnerships aim to close the healthcare access gap in Thailand’s capital where the number and distribution of primary care units are limited.  If successful, it could be a model adopted by other cities facing a similar challenge.    Dr Wirat Eungpoonsawat, Director of the Region 13 (Bangkok) overseeing Bangkok, said that the involvement of private clinics in the health system is vital to increasing the availability of healthcare units.   There are 69 state-owned public health centers under Bangkok Metropolitan Authority (BMA) in Bangkok, which is not enough to provide primary care to more than 10 million population.   Around 200 private clinics are partnering with the NHSO and offering free health services to beneficiaries of the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) managed by the NHSO.   These clinics can claim medical fees from the NHSO after they provide services to patients. It’s estimated that at least 500 private clinics are needed to fill up the healthcare gap in Bangkok.   “To ensure healthcare access, state and private health units must join hands to provide primary care. We plan to recruit private clinics in all 50 districts of Bangkok so patients can access primary care at any entry point,” said Dr Wirat.   Currently, the NHSO is recruiting private clinics which can be those open during full or partial office hours. They must register legally with the Ministry of Public health. Their staff must have medical licenses.    The clinics can claim medical fees for more than 4,000 items. The transactions will be made every 15 days.   Dr Wirat said that the NHSO had improved its reimbursement system and hoped to speed up the claiming process, with transactions being made every three days.    The NHSO targets to sign contracts with 30 to 50 private clinics by October 1, when UCS beneficiaries will be able to access primary care at any clinics regardless of their health units' registration.   In 2020, the NHSO received complaints allegation more than 100 private clinics overclaiming medical fees on intention.    The investigation found they falsy recorded the quantity of health services provided to UCS beneficiaries, intending to claim higher amounts of fees from the NHSO.  This led the NHSO to revoked their contracts and end partnerships with them.   Dr Wirat said that the contract termination is one of the reasons that the NHSO needed to seek new partnering clinics.    He also invited private clinics to open for this partnership as it will benefit the health of people and the health system as a whole.

42,42, NHSO supports disabled people to live independently    Wed 07 September 2022  ,"     NHSO supports disabled people to live independently  The National Health Security Office (NHSO) provides support to disabled people’s organizations promoting their independent lives.      On August 29, the NHSO in collaboration with the Thailand Council for Independent Living (TCIL) and the network of disabled people’s health held a conference to discuss the promotion of disabled people’s independent lives and find ways to increase their access to healthcare services and welfare.      Udomchok Churat, TCIL’s president, said during the event that promoting disabled people’s independence was important for gaining their dignity.      “People living with disabilities should be able to live independently with opportunities to live like normal people, including having the ability to travel and socialize,” he said.   “Our mission is to change their mindset and help them see their potential and be part of the society.”     During the event, disabled people who passed the training for promoting independent living received certificates.      The training is one of the TCIL’s activities to build disabled people’s skills as change-makers who can educate and encourage others to live independently.           Udomchok shared his experience visiting Japan some years ago when he observed the potential of disabled people there. They could commune to work and be the leaders of workplaces, he recalled.     This happened because of the availability of support, including the public transportation system designed to serve disabled people and inclusive employee recruitment.     In 2002, some Japanese disabled people organizations began providing support to Thai organizations working for improving disabled people's livelihoods.      The supports include training disabled people to live independently and providing them with mobility aids.      The training changed their perception and shifted their behaviors to be more socialized, eliminating their belief that disabled people must spend life on beds.      It also led to the establishment of TCIL.      In the past years, TCIL has opened centers for independent living in many provinces to train disabled people to depend on themselves and return them to society.      It has collaborated with the NHSO, which has provided the fund and assistance in running the centers.      Dr Jakkrit Ngowsiri, the NHSO deputy secretary-general, said that the key to disabled people’s independent living is their participation.      They must have the decision-making power to plan how they want to enhance their lives, instead of waiting for the state’s assistance passively.      “We support the idea of expanding centers for independent living in every province or at least 50% of provinces in Thailand,” said Dr Jakkrit.        “Disabled people need encouragement to lead the changes.”     He added that local administrative organizations could take part in running the center too.      There are some success stories of local government's role in improving disabled people’s livelihoods, including introducing them to jobs and services to fix their mobility aids when needed.

43,43, NHSO to recruit more partnered clinics in Bangkok    Thu 25 August 2022  ,"  NHSO to recruit more partnered clinics in Bangkok    The National Health Security Office (NHSO) will develop partnerships with Bangkok-based clinics to increase patients’ entry points to health services covered by the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS).                  Dr Jadej Thammatacharee, the NHSO secretary-general, explained that the partnership development aimed to solve people’s limited access to health services.   It is also the NHSO’s long-term strategy to strengthen primary care, which is seen as a vital element of the health system that improves overall health outcomes.   The NHSO has partnered with 200 clinics that provide free primary care to UCS beneficiaries.   The clinic operators can claim the medical fees from the NHSO, allowing people to access healthcare services regardless of their financial situation.   These partnered clinics have played a big role in health promotion and disease prevention programs and emergency response to the COVID-19 pandemic.   Their health staff has joined forces to battle the coronavirus by treating and monitoring mild-symptom patients isolated at home.   They have also assisted the NHSO in distributing free self-test kits to the general public and local communities.     Dr Jadej said there was the need to involve at least 500 clinics to improve healthcare access at an acceptable level.    According to the Department of Health Service Support (DHSS) under the Ministry of Public Health, there are 5,000 clinics in Bangkok.   Around 2,000 are general practice clinics, many of which have the potential to partner with the NHSO. The rest are beauty clinics.   “The overall number of clinics in Bangkok is enough to provide people healthcare access. But their owners are not interested in partnering with the NHSO, or they find our partner selection criteria don’t fit them.   We will revise the criteria to encourage more clinic participation in the UCS,” said Dr Jadej.   The NHSO’s selection of partners will consider the clinic locations and accessibility.                     The partner clinics must be registered with DHSS and operated eight hours a day. Those with official hours less than eight are not eligible for partnership.   But the NHSO is reconsidering partnering with them to increase healthcare entry points for the UCS beneficiaries.    Partnered clinics can claim medical fees from the NHSO under fee schedule payment, a list of medical procedures with maximum payment rates for each.   They will receive the payment within two to three days after submitting the medical claim to the NHSO, thanks to the improvement of the organization's e-reimbursement system.   More than 4,000 services and items are covered by the NHSO.   “Our beneficiaries will be convenient and be able to find health units near their homes if we involve more clinics,” said Dr Jadej.   “Their participation in the health system will upgrade primary care services in Bangkok. We plan to develop similar partnerships with clinics in other big cities.”    The NHSO is currently recruiting new partnered clinics that are expected to start providing health services to UCS beneficiaries from Oct 1 onward.

44,44, The NHSO Dashboard provides access to health data   Wed 17 August 2022  ,"          The National Health Security Office (NHSO) launched a health dashboard to give the public and health providers access to health data.   “NHSO Dashboard” was launched on the NHSO website on Aug 9, which contains the data on budget spending and health in eight areas — COVID-19, health promotion and disease prevention, kidney disease, diabetes and hypertension, flu vaccination, telemedicine service, cancer, and patients access to medicines and medical supplies.   “The NHSO has big data because it oversees more than 47 million people under the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) and proceeds claims for health providers across the nation,” said the NHSO secretary-general Dr Jadej Thammatacharee.   “We obtain more than 200 million and eight million records of outpatient and inpatient department every year respectively.”   The sources of data include the health data extracted from health providers’ claims submitted to the NHSO and Public Health Ministry of Public Health's data portal.   As the NHSO receives more than 200 billion baht from the Thai government each year, Dr Jadej said it was necessary to release data on the budget spending and return the health data to society.   The access to health data will ensure transparency and accountability of the NHSO as well as provide quick access to real-time data.   In the past, individuals must request datasets from health organizations which usually took weeks to months to obtain the datasets.   Dr Lalitaya Kongkam, the NHSO deputy secretary-general, said that the NHSO had set up the dashboard in Jul. It was first used for tracking expenses and services provided to COVID-19 patients and expanded to other areas of healthcare recently.    This health data will be valuable for the public, health providers and researchers as it shows health and disease trends. It can be used for multi-purposes, including research, monitoring and evaluation, and health policy discussion.   The NHSO staff can also use the data for planning the budget and improving efficiency in budget management, said Dr Lalitaya.   Pratuang Paodit, Director of the NHSO’s digital information support department, said that the datasets presented in the dashboard were clean and ready to be used.   The datasets include the number of people accessing health services, categorized by types of services and diseases, budget spent for providing those services at provincial, regional and national levels.   In the area of kidney failure treatment, the datasets include the number of patients receiving renal replacement therapy, health units offering the therapy, available physicians and renal replacement devices.   In the area of medical supplies, the public can access the data on medicine use and stockpile in each hospital.   The NHSO dashboard can be accessible in https://subsidy.nhso.go.th/subsidy/#/dashboard "
45,45, The new masterplan highlights health protection for all   Mon 15 August 2022  ," The new masterplan highlights health protection for all    The NHSO’s fifth Master Plan emphasizes the integration of digital platforms into health scheme management while remaining the vision to ensure health protection for everyone living in Thailand.   On Aug 1, the National Health Security board (NHSB) chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Public Health, Anutin Charnvirakul approved the new five-year master plan (2023-2027), which set the vision and goals for improving the organizational efficiency and people's healthcare access.   The NHSO secretary-general Dr Jadej Thammatacharee said that the fifth master plan focuses on many areas but all aim to increase health protection and coverage for everyone living on Thai soil.   Marginalized and vulnerable people such as the poor, ethnic people and undocumented Thais are included in this vision.   The master plan highlights the integration of digital platforms into the management of the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS), especially in the area of health data and medical fee reimbursement.   The NHSO will improve the health database and digitalize its overall workflow, from the UCS beneficiaries’ identity verification and e-claim process to medical fee transactions.   The reimbursement process must be fast and accurate while avoiding imposing paperwork burdens on health providers, said Dr Jadej.   The new master plan emphasizes the role of local governments and communities in health management and the benefits of primary care in sustaining the health system.   It also addresses 'Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) ' model — an integration of bio economy, circular economy and green economy which the Thai government underpins in its economic and social policies.   The model will enable sustainable development goals by promoting measures and policies, including renewable energy acceleration, waste recycling, and environmental protection.   It can be applied to all industries and sectors, including the health sector in which the NHSO plays a vital role in increasing people’s equitable access to quality healthcare.    Under the NHSO administration, BCG model will be implemented in a number of areas, including the procurement of sustainable health products and services.   Dr Jadej said the fifth master plan results from multi-stakeholder participation through a series of public hearings.   Some targets are set in the plan. For example, health impoverishment rate must remain lower than 0.25% of Thai population by 2027.   Health expenditure must account for no more than 5% of Thai GDP in the same year. The current ratio is 4.5%.   The compliance rate of the inpatient department must exceed 89% by 2029, increasing from 85% in 2020.    "
46,46, NHSO to push for safe abortion   Wed 10 August 2022  ," NHSO to push for safe abortion   The National Health Security Office (NHSO) will push for safe abortion, in response to the civil society groups calling for women’s access to safe and legal abortion care.   On Jul 27, the civil society groups comprising 59 organizations visited the NHSO headquarters to submit a letter voicing concern for women’s limited access to safe abortion care.    The groups include Choices Network Thailand, Association for Referral System for Safe Abortion (RSA), 1633 Call Center for unplanned pregnancies, and AIDS Access Foundation.   Kritaya Archavanitkul, the coordinator of Choices Network Thailand supporting women with unplanned pregnancies, said that Thai lawmakers had amended the abortion law in 2021 to allow safe and legal abortion.   But many health providers, especially the state hospitals, have rejected abortion cases despite the pregnant women’s necessity, she said.   The law legalizes abortion for women pregnant for no longer than 12 weeks. Women with more than 12-week pregnancies but no more than 20 weeks have the right to request abortion too if it is safe.   Physicians can also provide abortion care if the pregnancy put women at risk of physical and mental health, babies at risk of being disabled or having genetic disorders or if the pregnancy is caused by sexual assault.   “It has been 18 months since the law came into enforcement. But we have found many health providers refuse to provide abortion care to women despite the law legalizing it,” said Kritaya.   Her groups found other challenges, including the hospitals’ slow progress in performing genetic disorders tests for babies, forcing women to lose the opportunity to have abortions within the safe time range.    Dr Sanya Patrachai, a lecturer at Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, and a member of the Association for RSA Development, said that the test results might come out after 12 weeks of pregnancy.   In many cases, doctors pursued mothers to keep the babies against their will. When mothers insisted to have abortions, doctors forced them to seek services from other health providers.   This is against medical ethics, said Dr Sanya, but many women didn’t take legal action against doctors because they didn’t want to get into trouble. They ended up looking for other health providers, which might lead them to the risk of having unsafe abortions.   “I want to highlight two points [from the case studies of health providers rejecting women’s abortion requests.] First, there is no reason to reject them because the present medical technology can ensure safe abortion,” he said.   “Second, we know that many doctors rejected women’s abortion requests because they fear themselves being sinful. This is based on personal reasons rather than medical and professional reasons. Using personal reasons for medical decision-making is inappropriate and can increase the health risk of pregnant women.”   The civil society groups called the NHSO to collaborate with Ministry of Public Health, which oversees public hospitals, to issue a medical guideline for safe abortion that will allow pregnant women to access the services timely and widely.   They also urged the NHSO to coordinate with operators of other government healthcare schemes — Social Security Scheme and Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme — to draft the reimbursement guideline for abortion care and set up the complaint channels for abortion rejection cases.    After receiving the letter from civil society groups, the NHSO secretary-general Dr Jadej Thammathataree said that the NHSO would discuss the groups’ demands and push for access to safe abortion care in universal healthcare coverage. //////////    "
47,47, 10 orphan drugs added to the national drug list   Thu 28 July 2022  ," 10 orphan drugs added to the national drug list   Ten orphan drugs are added to the National List of Essential Medicines , allowing Thai patients living with rare diseases to access these drugs for free.   On Jul 4, the National Health Security Board(NHSB) chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Public Health Anutin Charnvirakul agreed with health experts’ suggestion to include 10 drugs into the National List of Essential Medicines’ category E(2).   With the drugs’ inclusion in the list, the NHSO could legally purchase the drugs and distribute them to hospitals caring for patients with rare diseases.    Category E(2) includes the orphan drug list  covered by the government’s healthcare schemes, providing patients equitable access to medications despite their high prices. The 10 drugs are:   1) Posaconazole, a triazole antifungal medication used to prevent certain fungus infections, including mucormycosis, in patients with a weakened immune system.   2) Linezolid, a medication used to treat infections, including enterovirus infection.   3) Sofosbuvir, Velpatasvir and Ribavirin used to treat Hepatitis C.   4) Octreotide acetate, a medication used to treat patients with thyrotropin secreting pituitary adenoma or benign tumors of the pituitary gland.   5) Bevacizumab injection, a medication used to treat babies born prematurely and with retinopathy.   6) Voriconazole, a medication used to treat invasive fungal infection caused by Trichosporon spp.   7) Rituximab injection used to treat neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, a rare condition where the immune system damages the spinal cord and the nerves of the eyes.   8) Nitisinone, a medication used to slow the effects of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1   9) Cysteamine bitartrate, a medication used to treat Nephropathic Cystinosis or autosomal recessive metabolic disorder   10) Sapropterin, a medication used to treat Phenylketonuria.     Dr Prasobsri Ungthavorn, chairman of the NHSO’s subcommittee for scopes and types of health services, said that the inclusion of orphan drugs into the National List of Essential Medicines is the mechanism that allows patients with rare diseases to access medications despite their high cost.   The selections of the drugs in the list are based on evidence-based and cost-effective studies, she said.   They don’t add financial burdens to the government but ensure patients’ access to quality and effective treatment.   ////////////////////        "
48,48, Every Thai newborn to get free hearing tests   Wed 27 July 2022  ,"  Every Thai newborn to get free hearing tests   Every Thai newborn is eligible to get a free hearing screening from now on.   On Jul 4, the National Health Security Board (NHSB) had the resolution to include newborn hearing screening into the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) benefits package.   All Thai newborns are eligible for this new benefit as they are covered by the UCS since their birth.      Chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Public Health Anutin Charnvirakul, the NHSB agreed that access to hearing screening is highly important as hearing ability determines the success of child development in their first five years.     The NHSO secretary-general Dr Jadej Thammatacharee said that hearing ability is one of five senses needed for learning.  The other four senses are touching, sighting, smelling, and taste.   “If children lose their hearing ability, they will have trouble learning the languages.   This undermines their ability to communicate with others, engage with society, memorize and learn new lessons when they join schools,” he said.   “Access to hearing tests is vital for every newborn. It allows parents to detect hearing loss in their children as early as possible, so the children will receive treatment and regain their hearing ability before it’s too late.”   World Health Organization reports that around 466 million people worldwide have disabling hearing loss, and 34 million are children.   In children under 15 years of age, 60% of hearing loss is attributable to preventable causes, including infections, complications at the time of birth, and the use of ototoxic medicines in expecting mothers and babies.   Hearing loss is found in 1.7 children per 1,000 Thai population. One by three of them have severe hearing problems.   Under the UCS, newborns will receive two types of hearing screening Otoacoustic Emission testing (OAE) and Automated Auditory Brainstem Response testing (AABR).   OAE is used to assess the status of an inner ear or cochlea. A small probe is placed into the ear containing a speaker to deliver sounds inside the ear.   If a child has a hearing problem, their ear will produce small volume of otoacoustic emissions.   But this test alone cannot diagnose hearing loss accurately. The child will need to go through AABR testing, in which small earphones are placed in the child’s ears to release the sounds.   Soft electrodes are placed near the ears and on the forehead to measure how the hearing nerves and brain respond to the sounds.   The NHSO estimates that around 555,200 babies will be delivered in 2023, requiring 17-million-baht to fund the hearing tests and equipment for hospitals.     Since Dec 2020, the NHSB has made free cochlear implants available for newborns with hearing loss.   Due to the devices’ high cost, the NHSO has negotiated with medical suppliers who can reduce the price to less than 600,000 baht per unit.   ///////////    "
49,49, All Thais can still access free COVID-19 health services despite its label as an 'endemic disease'    Fri 22 July 2022  ,"   All Thais can still access free COVID-19 health services despite its label as an 'endemic disease'    The National Health Security Office (NHSO) revised the reimbursement guideline for COVID-19 health services. Under the new guideline, all Thais can still access free services.   Since July, COVID-19 has been labeled an endemic disease in Thailand, prompting the NHSO to revise its reimbursement guideline to ensure the financial sustainability of universal health coverage.   The guideline revisions, approved by the NHSO board on Jul 4, highlight the shift of COVID-19 health services from emergency care to general healthcare services.   This means some COVID-19 health funds and fast-track reimbursement systems set up during the pandemic will be revoked.   This financial mechanism provided extra funds to health providers, ensuring they would not go bankrupt while providing free services to COVID-19 patients.   On the other hand, patients can access the treatment without fear of expensive medical costs.   As the health crisis has subsided, providing health providers with extra funds is unnecessary as the number of COVID-19 cases has drastically declined.   It will also lead to overspending, affecting the financial sustainability of the Thai healthcare schemes.    The NHSO Secretary-General Dr Jadej Thammatacharee said that the major revisions include:   1) The NHSO will not act as a clearing house for all healthcare schemes.   During the pandemic, the government assigned the NHSO to reimburse  COVID-19 health service fees to health providers, regardless of the registered healthcare schemes of their patients.   Having a single organization acting as a clearing house helped speed up the transaction and accelerate financial resource mobilization to tackle the health crisis.    The guideline revision will shift the reimbursement of the COVID-19 health service fees to the existing system, in which each healthcare scheme operator proceeds the reimbursement and transaction regarding the healthcare fees incurred by its beneficiaries.   Thailand’s main healthcare scheme operators are the NHSO, which manages the Universal Coverage Scheme, Social Security Office and Comptroller General's Department overseeing Social Security Scheme and Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme, respectively.   2) The NHSO will cancel the special fund covering healthcare fees for mild-symptom COVID-19 patients regardless of their registered healthcare schemes.   They can still get free healthcare services under the existing system, in which their healthcare scheme manager reimburses the costs for health providers.   3) The NHSO will cancel the actual-cost reimbursement for hospitals providing transportation to COVID-19 patients.    These hospitals also received extra funds for vehicle cleaning and PPE used during the trip.   Instead, the NHSO will cover the transportation cost based on mileage only.   4) The NHSO will cancel the actual-cost reimbursement for hospitals providing renal replacement therapy to COVID-19 patients, plus PPE used when performing the treatment and transportation if patients require inter-hospital transfers.   Instead, the NHSO will reimburse only the cost of renal replacement therapy in lumpsum or 1,500 baht per case.     5) The NHSO will revoke the specific-purpose fund covering the treatment for COVID-19 vaccine recipients with adverse effects.   They will still be treated under the fund for outpatient and inpatient services.   Dr Jadej emphasized that these changes will not affect people’s access to COVID-19 health services.   He added that beneficiaries of the Universal Coverage Scheme can still access benefits including free antigen test kits and medications.   ///////////////          "
50,50, Free dentures provided to elderly people   Wed 08 June 2022  ,"   Free dentures provided to elderly people   Hospitals in Thailand’s northeastern Bueng Kan province provide free dentures to the elderly, hoping to improve their diets and quality of life.   One of those hospitals includes Bung Khla Hospital which provides free dental services to the elderly, with support from the National Health Security Office (NHSO).   Under the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS), the NHSO covers the cost of dentures for the scheme’s beneficiaries, allowing many hospitals nationwide to offer devices to the patients without charges.      Thongdee Srichan, 92, a patient registered at Bung Khla Hospital, is one of many elderly people who received free dentures after many years of teeth loss.   “Since I started wearing dentures, I can eat most types of food and find little difficulties in chewing food. Providing free dentures to elderly people, especially those in rural areas, is very beneficial,” he said.   “It’s not easy to find dental clinics in the rural areas. If there are clinics, many local people can’t afford dental services because they are considered expensive.”      Dr Physicpong Buengmum, head of Bueng Kan Hospital’s dental department, said that denture wearing helped restore teeth function, resulting in an increased selection of chewable foods and nutrition improvement.   “The NHSO’s inclusion of dentures in UCS benefits create opportunity for elderly to improve their health,” he said.   However, challenges remain. The shortage of dentists in public hospitals has forced many elderly people to wait longer for dental services. Only a few dentists are stationed at each hospital.   Despite the availability of free dentures, Dr Physicpong said that elderly people may need to wait for more than a month to get the dentures ready for them.      The NHSO deputy secretary-general Dr Athaporn Limpanyalers said that the NHSO had introduced several dental benefits to the UCS members. These include tooth filling, scaling, and extraction.   The benefits also cover implant support dentures, which dentures are embedded in the bone and fixed on the gums. This benefit targets elderly people who have lost their whole teeth for a long period of time, resulting in flatted-shaped gums.   Though implant support dentures are high cost, Dr Athaporn said the NHSO moved forward with including it in the UCS’ benefits package because of the difficulties the elderly people may endure.   It is estimated that around 58% of elderly people aged between 60 and 74 have functional teeth that help them consume food properly. The share reduces to 22% for elderly people aged over 80.   To prevent serious dental problems in old age, the NHSO has collaborated with other health organizations, including the Thai Health Promotion Foundation, to raise concerns for dental health in children and adults.   The organizations also partner to campaign for dental health, including educating the public to have regular tooth brushing and dental checkups once a year.       Dr Athaporn said that proper dental care at early ages would reduce the health burden in senior years.

51,51, Adult diapers included in the UCS benefit   Wed 18 May 2022  ,"   Adult diapers included in the UCS benefit   The National Health Security Office (NHSO) added adult diapers or incontinence pads into the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) 's benefits package.   Each adult living with incontinence can get three diapers a day, which will help them save costs and continue living everyday life.   ""Access to free adult diapers will help patients, especially bed-ridden patients and the elderly, improve their quality of life.  But adults with incontinence at any age can request the diapers,"" said Anutin Charnvirakul, Minister of Public Health and Chairperson of the National Health Security  board.    We provide them with different types of diapers, all of which are quality products and made in Thailand.""   The NHS board approved the inclusion of adult diapers in the UCS benefits package from May 2.  This new benefit targets more than 53,300 bed-ridden patients and people living with incontinence.  It requires around 233 million baht budget obtained from the Community Health Fund, the NHSO's program to distribute healthcare resources to local communities.   Under the fund, elderly care centers and local administrative organizations can request financial support for projects that improve elderly care and livelihoods.   The amount of distributed diapers, three pieces per day per person, is based on the Department of Health's recommendation.   The NHSO Secretary-General Dr Jadej Thammatacharee said that the introduction of free adult diapers into UCS benefits resulted from the NHSO's consultation with the scheme's beneficiaries.   Many patients voiced their difficulties living with incontinence, including the financial burden of purchasing diapers, which they need to wear every day to live a normal life.   ""The NHSO studied the possibility of introducing this benefit, including its cost and impact.  We found out that it will largely improve the quality of life of many bed-ridden patients and elderly and reduce the expense for their families,"" said Dr Jadej.   ""Being able to introduce it is considered one of our successful milestones.""   As the Thai population is aging, the NHSO has continually introduced new items and programs into the UCS to improve the elderly's quality of life.   These include expanding rehabilitation therapy centers into local communities under the Provincial Rehabilitation Fund, which provides provincial administrative organizations with financial assistance for improving the health and well-being of disabilities and the elderly.   Having the rehabilitation centers in the target groups' communities will ensure the consistency of physical therapy and the desired outcomes. Patients don't need to commute to hospitals, which can be costly and time-consuming and discourage them from getting regular treatment.     In Jan, 72 centers were opened in 13 districts of Saraburi province in central Thailand.   Around 50 physiotherapists stationed at hospitals in the province have taken turns staying at the centers and providing regular rehabilitation therapy to local communities.      "
52,52, WHO draws COVID-19 lessons learned from Thailand   Tue 17 May 2022  ,"   WHO draws COVID-19 lessons learned from Thailand   World Health Organization (WHO) chose Thailand as one of the few countries with the best COVID-19 management, leading the country to pilot a health preparedness review that draws on lessons learned during the pandemic.   The selection was revealed during a press conference on the Universal Health and Preparedness Review (UHPR) results, held from April 21-29.     During the press conference, Dr Samira Asma, the Assistant WHO Director-General, said Thailand's experience would benefit WHO country members and sparked new ideas to develop emergency response mechanisms for the next health crisis.   Thailand would be invited to share its experience coping with the pandemic at the World Health Assembly 2022, held from May 22-28 in Geneva, Switzerland.     Minister of Public Health Anutin Charnvirakul, also the chairperson of the National Health Security board, said that multi-sectoral collaboration was the key to Thailand's effective COVID-19 response and management.   The number of new cases didn't increase at an alarming rate after the Songkran holiday (or Thai new year's day,) which Thai people often travel across the country.    The collaboration has involved many players from individuals, many of whom strictly wear masks and avoid traveling to risk areas, and local communities to organizational levels.   Players in the health sector  including health village volunteers, hospitals at all levels, and local administrative organizations  have worked together in spiderweb networks to implement health measures and distribute coronavirus vaccines to the people.   They have also collaborated to identify risk groups, including the elderly and people living with chronic diseases, and provide them with assistance.   Along with multi-sectoral collaboration, Thailand's effective pandemic management is also a result of practical health measures.   Anutin said that the Thai government's leaders and policymakers had allowed the health measures to be adjustable and changeable based on the situation.   In addition, the Thai health system was established four decades ago with the expansion of health facilities, capacity building for health workers, and the introduction of Universal Health Coverage (UHC), which ensures healthcare access to every Thai.   UHC is a center-piece health mechanism that allowed the Thai government to mobilize healthcare resources to tackle the pandemic while guaranteeing that hospitals would not go bankrupt by providing care to COVID-19 patients.    On the other hand, people can timely access free coronavirus testing and treatment, which help contain the virus.   Dr Amporn Benjaponpitak, director-general of the Department of Mental Health, said that the effective pandemic management was reflected in the recent mental health survey of Thai people.   The survey, conducted between Jan and Feb via the Mental health Check platform, showed that Thai people had better mental health conditions.   Only 2.55% of them were stressful due to the pandemic, reduced from 4.74% in the previous survey. Around 3.12% risked having depression, decreased from 5.74%, and 1.54% risked committing suicide, which declined from 3.14%           "
53,53, 'OP Anywhere' improves healthcare access   Tue 10 May 2022  ,"   'OP Anywhere' improves healthcare access   Hospital staff and patients reported the positive impact of 'OP Anywhere ' or outpatient everywhere, a new public health policy encouraging people to access primary care at any available health unit.     Ministry of Public Health Anutin Charnvirakul, also chairman of the National Health Security board, announced the launch of OP Anywhere early this year, intending to improve people's access to primary care.     Before the announcement, beneficiaries of the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) must request outpatient services from public hospitals they are registered with.   They couldn't access health services in other hospitals unless the hospital's staff approved and issued inter-hospital transfer papers for them.    Under the new policy, UCS beneficiaries can request primary care services from any primary health unit, including public health centers, subdistrict health promotion hospitals, primary care units under hospitals, community health centers, and community clinics partnering with the NHSO.   The services cover preventive care, health promotion and disease prevention, physical rehabilitation, and primary care for any illness.   The patients will be transferred to higher-capacity hospitals if they need specialist or intensive care.      OP Anywhere was piloted in a few hospitals last year and extended to the whole country early this year.   The extension followed the hospitals' reports of positive outcomes after the policy implementation. Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Hospital is one of those hospitals.     ""Our core team had meetings to plan for our staff preparation. Communication with our staff and the general public is the key,"" said Dr Chakkri Sarikanon, the hospital's deputy director.   Based in Ayutthaya province north of Bangkok, the hospital staff communicated to the patients and the public via its website, social media, signs, and in-person dialogues with visitors.   The hospital staff needed to adapt to a new coding system for e-claiming the medical fees with NHSO.     Once the UCS beneficiaries arrive at hospitals, their registration status will be reviewed by hospital staff.   Those who do not register with hospitals will receive special code “UQ”, which alerts the health team to provide free primary care services.     Between Jan and Mar, 279 visitors received free health services even though they were not registered at the hospital. Their common symptoms were gastroenteritis, stomachache, and rash.   They visited the hospitals twice on average, which did not exhaust the hospital resources. Most of them were domestic or seasonal migrants who temporarily worked in Ayutthaya.   ""Their number is very small when compared to our 1,900 daily visitors, so their arrivals did not lead to hospital overcapacity,"" said Dr Chakkri.   ""The policy is very beneficial and convenient, especially for patients needing immediate care and those with chronic diseases requiring undisrupted medical consultations.""   Similarly, Wat Phraya Tikaram subdistrict health promotion hospital reported positive outcomes after adopting OP Anywhere policy.     The hospital's director Suntri Kansuwiroa said that the policy helped improve patients' access to care, especially those from low-income families.   Previously, they avoided visiting the hospital because they couldn't afford the medical fees.   ""I moved from northeastern Thailand to Ayutthaya province. But my name is still registered at the hospital in my hometown.     The policy allows me to get health services from a local hospital here without traveling back to my home province,"" said a patient Supannee Deetachote.   ""This policy is really good for a migrant like me. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to afford healthcare if I was sick. Now I'm not worried anymore.""   /////////////    "
54,54, Telemedicine service provided to COVID-19 patients   Mon 02 May 2022  ,"  Telemedicine service provided to COVID-19 patients   The National Health Security Office (NHSO) joins hands with Siam Commercial Bank (SCB) and Good Doctor Technology Thailand (GDTT) to provide telemedicine service to COVID-19 patients.   The collaboration was announced at a press conference held at the NHSO’s headquarters in Bangkok on Apr 26.      During the event, the NHSO Secretary-General Dr Jadej Thammatacharee said that several thousand cases of new COVID-19 infections had still been reported daily. More than 90% of these cases are asymptomatic or mild symptom patients classified as ‘green’ cases.      This group of patients can be treated in the outpatient department and under self-isolation, prompting the Ministry of Public Health to adjust its coronavirus treatment guideline by encouraging them to isolate themselves at home under the doctors’ guidance.      The collaboration will provide the patients with telemedicine service via Spring Up, a digital health mobile application run by SCB, with support from GDTT, an experienced telemedicine service provider.     Dr Sudhichai Chokekijchai, GDTT’s head of medical, said that any individuals who tested positive could download Spring Up application without paying any fees. Each of them must register their name, mobile number, address and symptoms and submit an image of a self-test kit that shows a positive result.   The information will appear in GDTT’s database system. The company’s staff will screen through the information and contact the patients for identity verification. They will then virtually meet doctors who will prescribe medicine.   The prescriptions will be sent to a pharmacy partnered with the NHSO. Over 400 pharmacies across Thailand have participated in this initiative. Grab’s rider will deliver medicine to the patient’s address. The doctor will monitor the patient’s symptoms within 48 hours after the first consultation.    “Our company has provided telemedicine services in Thailand and Indonesia. In Thailand, we started providing service in Jun 2021. Most of our customers are corporates,” said Dr Sudhichai.   “We have provided services to more than 4,000 self-isolated patients during the Delta and Omicron waves in partnership with the NHSO. Our previous collaboration with the NHSO proves our ability to operate telemedicine effectively, leading us to discuss the expansion of eligible patients via SCB’s Spring Up application.”     Chalee Asavathiratham, SCB’s Chief Digital Banking Officer, said Spring Up application was co-developed by GDTT and ‘SCB DBANK,’ a digital banking department under SCB.   “We’re willing to collaborate with the NHSO in increasing healthcare access for COVID-19 outpatients,” he said.   The telemedicine service via the Spring Up application will be piloted in Bangkok and its metropolitan area from Apr 26.   However, only beneficiaries of the Universal Coverage Scheme, civil servants’ and local administrative organizations’ medical benefits can access the service. Members of the Social Security Scheme are not eligible for this service at the moment.   The NHSO is discussing with the Social Security Office how to provide telemedicine to its members, said Dr Jadej.   The NHSO has worked with public and private organizations throughout the pandemic to increase COVID-19 patients’ access to treatment.   Those organizations include health providers and the Pharmacy Council of Thailand — which local pharmacies have provided medicine and consultation to self-isolated patients since Mar this year.   ////////////////              "
55,55, Private hospitals join the effort to provide medical care to COVID-19 patients   Fri 29 April 2022  ,"   Private hospitals join the effort to provide medical care to COVID-19 patients   Over a hundred private hospitals have collaborated with the National Health Security Office (NHSO) to provide medical care to asymptomatic and mild-symptom coronavirus patients.   On Mar 8, the cabinet approved the Ministry of Public Health's proposal to withdraw asymptomatic and mild-symptom coronavirus patients from Universal Coverage for Emergency Patients (UCEP)a program that allows critical patients to admit to any hospital regardless of their registry hospitals.   During the height of the pandemic, the government made coronavirus patients eligible for UCEP to save people's lives and contain the spread of the virus. However, the recent surge of Omicron cases is different from the previous coronavirus waves that harm the majority of infection cases.   Currently, more than 90% of people with positive test results are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, meaning they don't need intensive care at hospitals.   These patients are classified as 'green' cases, which can be treated at home and in community isolation facilities under the doctors' guidance.   The intermediate and critically-ill patients are classified as 'yellow and 'red,' respectively.   They require intensive care hospitals' inpatient wards, prompting the Ministry of Public Health not to withdraw them from UCEP's eligibility list.   Though green cases are not eligible for UCEP, the NHSO has worked closely with the Ministry of Public Health and healthcare scheme operators to ensure the patients' access to medical consultation and treatment.     Since early Apr, the NHSO has collaborated with private hospitals to launch a new initiative that allows patients under the green category to request medical consultations, medicine, and necessary assistance from private hospitals regardless of the patient's registry hospitals.   More than 100 private hospitals have participated in this effort. Beneficiaries of Civil Servant Medical Benefits and local administrative organizations' healthcare are eligible to get private hospitals' care under the initiative.   The eligible patients must meet the criteria, such as having a high body temperature (more than 37.5°C) and loss of smell and taste, sore throat, cough, running nose, or other relevant symptoms, including rash, diarrhea, or red eyes.   If the patients visit the outpatient ward, the NHSO will pay private hospitals 1,000 baht per case covering medical consultation, medicine (green chiretta, favipiravir and relevant drugs), health workers' time spent on monitoring patients (the first 48 hours after they report themselves at hospitals' outpatient department) and transport from home to hospitals if the patients' conditions worsen.    The NHSO will top up 300 baht to cover the hospitals' coordination fee if patients' symptoms worsen and request intensive care at hospitals.   If the patients must isolate at home, in community facilities or hospitel, the NHSO will cover the overall cost in a lump sum 6,000 baht for a patient who requires no more than six days of care, and 12,000 for one who needs more than seven days of care.   The coverage includes patients' food (3 meals a day), medicine, medical consultation and devices, chest X-rays if necessary, and health workers' hours spent on monitoring patients.   ""We appreciate the helping hands from private hospitals.

Tue 19 April 2022  ,"   Non-serious coronavirus patients to get support at pharmacies.    Asymptomatic and mild-symptom COVID-19 patients can request support, including free medicines and consultations, from pharmacies as part of the new initiative to increase Thai people’s access to care.   The initiative is a result of a collaboration between the National Health Security Office (NHSO) and the Pharmacy Council of Thailand (PCT).   Dr. Jadej Thammatacharee, the NHSO Secretary-General, said this initiative had engaged more than 700 pharmacy operators partnering with the NHSO.   The pharmacists under the initiative will provide free medicines and consultations to asymptomatic or mild-symptom patients isolated at home. The NHSO will cover the costs incurred from supporting those patients — 700 baht for each patient receiving support from a pharmacist.   The fund covers the consultation fee, medicines (including green chiretta capsules and anti-flu drug), hours spent on monitoring patients, and transportation fee if the patients’ symptoms worsen.     Starting in early Mar, the initiative is part of the Ministry of Public Health’s policy to increase asymptomatic and mild patients’ access to care. Anyone who tested positive can request care from hospitals’ outpatient departments and pharmacies by joining the NHSO-PCT initiative.     The COVID-19 patients will be monitored by pharmacists in the first 48 hours after they visit the pharmacies. If their conditions worsen, pharmacists will contact the hospital staff, who will pick up the patients and put them in intensive care.   The pharmacy operators joining the initiative will present stickers titled “the network of volunteer pharmacists for COVID-19 distant consultations” in front of their stores.   Preecha Bhandtivej, Vice President of the Pharmacy Council of Thailand (PCT), said that using pharmacies as access points to care for non-serious cases would help reduce hospital crowding.   The NHSO and PCT have set criteria for eligible patients receiving support at pharmacies to ensure the patients' safety. The patients must not age over 60, be pregnant women and bed-ridden patients, and have health risk factors, including obesity.   “[The patients] can be confident when consulting with the pharmacists, who have extensive knowledge in medicine and the coronavirus. They can provide patients with excellent care,” said Preecha.     However, only Thai patients under the Universal Coverage Scheme, Civil Servants Medical Benefits, and local administrative organizations’ healthcare schemes can request support under the initiative.   Preecha encourages Social Security Office, overseeing Social Security Scheme that covers 16 million workers, to join the initiative which will provide channels for their beneficiaries to access quick support.     Dr Athaporn Limpanyalers, the NHSO Deputy Secretary-General, said that the NHSO had implement patients’ identification system to record and track their health condition.    Patients must show their identification cards to pharmacists, who will record the patients’ request for support and their symptoms in AMED Telehealth — a software developed by Assistive Technology and Medical Devices Research Center(A-MED), the National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA).   These records are evidence used by the NHSO’s claim process. The transactions will be made directly to the pharmacy operators’ bank accounts.    “Our reimbursement system is transparent and trustable,” said Dr Athaporn.       "
57,57, NHSO clarified UCEP benefit guidelines for Covid-19 patients as of 16 March 2022   Mon 04 April 2022  ,"    NHSO clarified UCEP benefit guidelines for Covid-19 patients as of 16 March 2022   NHSO has clarified guidelines on the treatment and management of Covid-19 patients under the gold card benefits after the Cabinet resolved to modify Universal Coverage for Emergency Patients, or UCEP.   For the green level group, asymptomatic or mild-symptom patients, starting from 16 March 2022 onwards. Patients can receive medical treatment at hospitals according to their health insurance scheme, or at primary care unit nationwide. The treatment would follow the guidelines of “Meet, Give Away and Complete” or “home isolation”.   The risk group can call 1330 to register as instructed by the measures. For Social Security Scheme, patients can receive medical treatment at hospitals that has been registered. For Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme, Patient can be treated at all state hospitals.     Dr Jadej Thammatacharee, Secretary-General of National Health Security Office (NHSO), revealed that the Cabinet agreed to revise criteria for Universal Coverage for Emergency for COVID-19 Patients (UCEP Plus) at its meeting on 8 March 2022, allowing patients with yellow and red group to get free healthcare services according to the measures. This would be effective on 16 March 2022.   For 30-baht scheme or Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) from 16 March 2022 onwards, those who has COVID-19 antigen test result showing 2 lines, and has been indicated as Green Group, asymptomatic or mild-symptom patients, such as fever of 37.5 Celsius or higher, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, cough, runny nose, rash, diarrhoea, conjunctivitis or irritated eyes, will be treated according to new guidelines of Ministry of Public Health. Such guidelines include Outpatient Treatment with Self Isolation, “Meet, Give Away and Complete”, and “home isolation”.   The selection of treatment depends on the discretion of the physician as to whether or not they should be treated at the hospitals where they are registered. Moreover, patients can have medical treatment at primary care units nationwide without a patient referral document.   (Primary care units include health centers, primary care units in hospitals, community health centers, health service centers, as well as private clinic that under NHSO network) Including private hospitals that has contact with NHSO to provide service for the Green Group UCS.   However, during the treatment, according to the guidelines, those who are treated under “Meet, Give Away and Complete” or “home isolation” program , and whose symptoms develop severely into Yellow-Red Group, will be referred to hospitals by using UCEP Plus.   Dr Jadej stated that during this transition, after revising criteria of UCEP for the green level group, hospitals and private clinics outside NHSO network will be unable to claim treatment costs for COVID-19 patients.   NHSO already prepared three solutions by allowing hospitals to apply for registration to participate in COVID-19 specific services, which can reimburse the expenses of emergency patients according to the National Health Security Act of Section 7, and notification of the new criteria for reimbursement for Outpatient Treatment with Self Isolation or “Meet, Give Away and Complete” policy from Ministry of Public Health.   For risk group-Covid-19 patients. Risk factors include those aged 60 years old and above, people living with seven underlying diseases: Chronic respiratory disease, Coronary artery disease, Chronic kidney disease, Cerebrovascular disease, Obesity, Cancer, Diabetes and Pregnant women, in which gestational age is 12 weeks or above, children aged 0-5 years, disabled people, and bedridden patient, call the National Health Security Office’s Contact center at 1330 press 18 to register as instructed by the measures.       For Social Security Scheme, patients can receive medical treatment at the hospital where you are registered, every health facilities in the Network of Social Security System and all state hospitals.   For Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme, Patients can be treated at all state hospitals and private hospitals that have contact with NHSO to provide service for Green Group. For outpatient treatment with self isolation or “Meet, Give Away and Complete” follow the Ministry of Public Health policy.   For more information contact the NHSO Contact center by calling the 1330 hotline 24 hours a day or click http://line.ee/zzn3pU6 , official LINE account, @nhso.   4 Easy ways to check treatment entitlement.   1.

58,58, CRRT new reimbursement rate   Thu 10 March 2022  ,"     CRRT new reimbursement rate  The National Health Security Office (NHSO) has revised the reimbursement policy for hospitals providing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), allowing more patients with acute kidney injury to access the treatment.    On February 7, the NHSO board chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Public Health Anutin Charnvirakul had a resolution on revising the CRRT reimbursement guideline based on the suggestion of the NHSO's subcommittee on the types and scopes of healthcare services.   The subcommittee's chairman Prof. Dr Prasobsri Ungthavorn said that the new reimbursement system would be based on a daily rate, reflecting the actual cost of CRRT treatment.      Hospitals providing CRRT to patients with acute kidney failure and in a critical stage can claim 15,000 baht for the first day of treatment and 10,000 baht per day in the following days. This new rate will be introduced on March 1.    In 2003-2017, the NHSO adopted fee-schedule payment for CRRT with a payment ceiling at 2,000 baht per day.    It shifted to Diagnosis-Related Group payment in 2018, discouraging some hospitals from providing the service. They were concerned that the payment would not cover the overall cost incurred during the treatment, which can take months until the patients fully recover.     ""The new payment rate will motivate hospitals to provide CRRT to patients, who will have better access to the treatment in return,"" said the NHSO Secretary-General Dr. Jadej Thammatacharee.    ""It's also cost-effective. It will cost us around 55,000 baht to provide treatment to a patient, while we paid around 56,000 baht per case under the Diagnosis-Related Group payment.    If there are more cases in future, we may consider negotiating the prices of dialysis fluid, which is the main cost incurred during CRRT.""   CRRT is commonly used to provide renal support for critically ill patients with acute kidney injury, particularly patients who are hemodynamically unstable.   Acute kidney injury is a sudden episode of kidney failure that happens within a few hours or a few days, disrupting kidneys that help balance fluid in the human body. It can affect other organs such as the brain, heart, and lungs.    Prof. Dr Prasobsri said that CRRT is the best alternative treatment for patients with acute kidney failure, who usually couldn't be treated by other types of therapy due to their critical stage.    Some studies suggest that CRRT can help save healthcare budgets in the long term compared to intermittent hemodialysis, while the effectiveness of both types of treatment can be comparable.    Expanding access to CRRT is also applicable to Thailand, in which hospitals at all levels — from general, regional to university hospitals — can provide the treatment. Their capacity is yet full. It is estimated that each hospital can take up additional 48 patients for CRRT.    The Nephrology Society of Thailand reported that more than 164,000 patients received kidney failure therapy in all types combined in 2020, and around 6,580 had kidney transplantation.   Many people diagnosed with chronic kidney disease do not know they have the disease, similar to those with acute kidney injury who are unaware of their risks.       "
59,59, Public-private partnership to improve HPDP access    Thu 10 March 2022  ,"              Public-private partnership to improve HPDP access   The operators of three healthcare financing schemes and private hospitals have joined hands to increase people's access to health promotion and disease prevention (HPDP) services.   The three are National Health Security Office (NHSO) overseeing Universal Coverage Scheme, Social Security Office and Comptroller General's Department, which has managed Social Security Scheme and Civil Servant Medical Benefits Scheme, respectively.    Each has managed its healthcare scheme separately, with its own claim system and benefits package that cover HPDP services differently.   ""The Thai government has set a policy to increase every Thai's access to health promotion and disease prevention services regardless of their registered healthcare schemes. The operators of healthcare financing schemes must work together to make this happen,"" said the NHSO Deputy Secretary-General Dr Jakkrit Ngowsiri.   ""The NHSO has been assigned to coordinate the scheme operators and redesign the claim system.""     The NHSO has years of experience running HPDP programs in partnership with hospitals, local administrative organizations and communities.    It has initiated a Community Health Fund, which engages local stakeholders in several projects, including home care for elders and people with disabilities, health literacy improvement, and hygiene and safety assurance.    The NHSO has also allocated funds for provincial, municipality and sub-district governments, which run community-based HPDP programs, including disease screening tests and physical rehabilitation arrangement for residents.   However, the beneficiaries of the Social Security Scheme and Civil Servant Medical Benefits Scheme have experienced gaps in accessing HPDP services due to the limitation of benefits packages and HPDP services at their registered hospitals.    Many beneficiaries of these two healthcare schemes receive healthcare services from private hospitals, differing from Universal Coverage Scheme's beneficiaries who get services from state hospitals that adopt the government's HPDP access policy.        In early Feb, the operators of the three healthcare financing schemes and private hospitals met to discuss how they could work together to increase HPDP access for their beneficiaries.    They have agreed that private hospitals partnering with the scheme operators would continue providing HPDP services in the benefits packages of Social Security Scheme and Civil Servant Medical Benefits Schemes, and claim medical fees from the Social Security Office and Comptroller General's Department, respectively.   The beneficiaries of these two schemes will also access some HPDP services under Universal Coverage Scheme, and hospitals can reimburse the fees from the NHSO.     This will allow them to access more HPDP services, including phenylketonuria and hypothyroidism screening tests for newborns, glasses for children with vision problems, legal abortion, and cervical cancer screening tests provided to all Thai beneficiaries.    Rachata Aunsuk, Director of legal and healthcare benefits department, Comptroller General's Department, said that his organization partnered with 200 private hospitals to provide healthcare benefits to civil servants and their families.   ""We will encourage our partnered hospitals to take part because this cross-organizational collaboration will benefit our beneficiaries,"" he said.   On the other hand, the Social Security Office has partnered with 89 private hospitals across Thailand and introduced 14 items of HPDP services in the Social Security Scheme since 2019. ""If private hospitals join our effort, they will likely get more patients,"" said Yuwadee Aukkaniwan, director of the healthcare rights department under the Social Security Office.   ""Our effort will help improve our beneficiaries' health and reduce the healthcare burden for the country.""        "
60,60, NHSO shortcuts COVID-19 claim processing time   Wed 23 Febuary 2022  ,"  NHSO shortcuts COVID-19 claim processing time   Last year, the National Health Security Office (NHSO) began adjusting its claim system to help hospital operators get quick funds for COVID-19 health services, including mass testing and emergency care.    In the pandemic, the NHSO has acted as a clearinghouse for the Thai government's three healthcare schemes Universal Coverage scheme, Social Security Scheme and Civil Servant Medical Benefits, which combine cover healthcare for more than 99% of the Thai population.     The NHSO took around a month to review claim documents and transfer the fund to hospital operators before the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020. However, the rising demand for emergency care during the pandemic, also increasing the hospitals' operation cost, pushed the NHSO to accelerate its transaction process.   It could eventually reduce the claim processing time from one month to two weeks. But this is not fast enough to ensure hospitals' financial liquidity, especially during the recent surge of Omicron cases.    On Feb 17, the NHSO board chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul decided to introduce a one-day claim system in which hospital operators will be reimbursed for medical expenses incurred from COVID-19 health services within a day. The transactions will be made online.     To pay hospitals faster, said the NHSO Secretary-General Dr Jadej Thammatacharee, his team had worked with the Public Health Ministry to revise the claim and payment guidelines.   The revisions include the avoidance of applying Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) payment in mild-symptom coronavirus cases. Medical expenses incurred from these cases will be paid in a lump sum, reducing the time spent on claim document reviews.   For example, a hospital providing less than six days of treatment to a mild-symptom patient will receive 6,000 baht per case, and 12,000 baht for a case requiring more than seven days of treatment.       Similarly, lump-sum payment is applied with COVID-19 tests and patients' rooms. Hospital operators can claim 250 and 350 baht per test when using chromatography and FIA antigen test kits, respectively.    Around 900 and 1,100 baht will be paid to health units providing RT-PCR tests that detect two and three viral genes, respectively. The amount of payment may be adjusted due to the testing's cost reduction.   Recently, the NHSO has set a new guideline for paying health units providing self-test kits to people at risk of COVID-19. Health units  including hospitals, clinics and pharmacies partnering with the NHSO   can claim 55 baht per unit of self-test kit.    They are encouraged to purchase the devices under the government's 'innovation list""  the list of innovative goods and services that involve Thai people or organizations in their development. These items are quality guaranteed by the Thai government. Purchasing them will help support the local producers and encourage more research and development.   Hospitals providing rooms to COVID-19 patients will be paid based on their severity of symptoms, classified into five levels. They will also get 550 baht to cover a set of personal protective equipment.   In addition, the NHSO has covered the cost of transporting mild-symptom patients 1,900 baht per day for a non-emergency transport vehicle or a for-hire vehicle that is not an ambulance. This vehicle, of which a driver must adopt hygiene and safety guidelines, can fill up the gap left by limited numbers of available ambulances during the pandemic.   Dr Jadej said that the new payment guidelines would help the NHSO process the transaction quicker. It also relieves the financial burden for the government which covers medical fees for every Thai.   //////////////    "
61,61, Accessible and affordable COVID-19 self-test kits   Tue 22 Febuary 2022  ,"  Accessible and affordable COVID-19 self-test kits   Thai people at risk of COVID-19 infection can access free self-test kits purchased and distributed by the National Health Security Office (NHSO)   Thailand has experienced a surge of highly contagious Omicron cases, in which the majority of infected people show show asymptomatic or mild symptoms.   Quick access to self-test kits, or Antigen Test Kit (ATK), is crucial for identifying the cases while containing the spread of the virus.   In July last year, the NHSO purchased 8.5 million self-test kits and distributed them to health units across the country. Health staff then hand the self-test kits to anyone at risk of COVID-19.   However, having the NHSO act as the sole distributor can’t catch up with the rising demand for self-test kits amidst the surge of Omicron cases.   The NHSO board decided last week to introduce an option in which health units can purchase the self-test kits and claim the cost from the NHSO. They can request 55 baht per unit of self-test kits.    Dr Jadej Thammatacharee, the NHSO Secretary-General, said that health units were encouraged to purchase self-test kits under the government’s ‘innovation list” — the list of innovative goods and services that involve Thai people or organizations in their development.   These items are quality guaranteed by the Thai government. Purchasing them will help support the local producers and encourage more research and development.   “The NHSO can act as an intermediary between the self-test kits manufacturers and the Government Pharmaceutical Organization (who represents the health units) in agreeing on prices and purchasing quantity,” said Dr Jadej.   “We have coordinated with health units to design a distribution plan, which allows people to get self-test kits quickly and easily.”    To get the self-test kits, an individual must fill out a risk assessment form on PaoTang mobile application or at health units, clinics, or pharmacies partnering with the NHSO. Self-test kits will be given if the assessment finds the person at risk of Covid-19.   Currently, the government has encouraged anyone with positive test results and mild symptoms to isolate themselves at home instead of staying at hospitals, of which beds are reserved for critical cases.   They can also stay at community isolation facilities — the communal buildings or spaces, including town halls, community meeting spaces, and temples that are turned into isolation areas.    Hospitels or hotels turned into isolation facilities are another available option for infected persons who can’t isolate themselves at home.    They will receive three meals a day, medicine, and necessary medical devices, including oxygen saturation monitors and thermometers.   Doctors will closely monitor the patients via online chats or video calls. If they develop severe symptoms, they will be transferred to hospitals for intensive care.   To increase access to COVID-19 tests, the Government Pharmaceutical Organization has manufactured self-test kits and sold them at an affordable price. One unit is priced around 35 baht, four-time lower than the imported self-test kits   ////////////////////        "
62,62, First-grade students to receive free eye tests.   Mon 21 Febuary 2022  ,"  First-grade students to receive free eye tests.   Vision problems in children affect many aspects of intellectual development, including language learning, interaction with people, and social skills.    The symptoms, which usually emerge when kids reach the age of 1.5 to four, may be hard to detect because young children may not be aware of their vision problems.    The common signs that may indicate vision problems include; frequent eye rubbing or blinking, short attention span, and complaints of discomfort and fatigue.   Thus, access to eye tests can help parents and teachers identify children’s vision problems and provide them with glasses, which will help them learn and develop skills as normal children.    “We are aware that vision problems can silently disturb child learning and development,” said Dr Jakkrit Ngowsiri, Deputy Secretary-General of the National Health Security Office (NHSO) overseeing the UCS.    “We include eye tests and free glasses in the benefits package of the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS), which cover the healthcare fees for every Thai child since birth.”   In principle, the NHSO wants to support schools and hospitals in providing free eye tests to every child aged three to 12.    But, in practice, it is impossible at the moment because of the limited number of ophthalmologists found in only 200 out of 38,000 health units across Thailand.   Currently, the NHSO has prioritized providing free eye tests to first-grade students or around 700,000 kids. They will get free glasses once the tests confirm their vision problems. Teachers and parents of children in other grades can directly request free eye tests and glasses at state hospitals.     “The NHSO has set up the committee for the ophthalmology service plan, which coordinates with relevant government offices and organizations to run eye tests at schools. It has also monitored the outcomes, including the coverage of vision screening tests and children’s access to glasses.,” said Dr Jakkrit.   “Eye tests are part of the NHSO’s health promotion and disease prevention program that aims for keeping people healthy.”   The Ministry of Education has encouraged students to get tests while putting teachers in vision screening training, allowing them to provide students with eye tests and identify vision problems’ symptoms.      On the other hand, the Royal College of Ophthalmologists of Thailand and the Public Health Ministry’s Metta Eye Center have provided know-how and training to health personnel — ophthalmologists, optometrists, and nurses — who must provide services to children.    Local Administrative Organizations under the Ministry of Interior have covered the travel cost of parents and children with vision problems when they need to visit hospitals for eye tests and get glasses.    Around 245,150 students, or 32% of first-grade students, had eye tests in 2021. About 6,200 or 2.5% of them were diagnosed with vision problems, and 2,929 received glasses.     This year, the NHSO set a target to offer eye tests to 80% of first-grade students, or around 600,000 children. About 3% of them will likely have vision problems.  /////////////         "
63,63, New HD cost reimbursement policy will ease heavy burden on kidney patients   Thu 10 Febuary 2022  ,"  New HD cost reimbursement policy will ease heavy burden on kidney patients   For those who are living with chronic kidney failure and require hemodialysis (HD) two to three times a week, the cost of purifying the blood and other related costs are estimated to be almost 20,000 baht per person per month, according to the information from Phuean Rok Tai (Nephrology Friends), an association of patients with kidney disease.   That is quite a heavy burden for any middle and low income families, particularly during this sluggish economic situation, said Thanaphon Dokkaeo, president of the association.   The decision by the National Health Security Board (NHSB) to reimburse patients with chronic kidney failure opting for HD instead of peritoneal dialysis (PD), effective Feb 1, 2022, therefore came as excellent news to all kidney patients, he said.   On behalf of all kidney patients, He expressed their gratitude for this decision by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Public Health Anutin Charnvirakul and the NHSB, which is absolutely in line with the patient-centred care principle.   His concern, however, remains about the readiness of the HD service system to accommodate this additional health benefit for kidney patients, which he said will need to be closely monitored and assessed.   There should not be a problem in large cities as both state- and private-run hospitals are believed to have sufficient resources to support the implementation of this new policy, said Dr Suchai Sritippayawan, secretary-general of Nephrology Society of Thailand (NST).   It is estimated that there will be about 15,000 kidney patients needing and choosing HD over PD in the first year of the implementation of this new policy, he said.   Of this number, about 6,000 people will be those patients who had already chosen HD, although that meant they had to pay for the cost of HD on their own, while three-fourths of the about 8,000 patients newly diagnosed to have chronic kidney failure andneeding kidney dialysis, or about 5,000, will also choose HD over PD, he said.   The rest will be those who previously underwent PD regularly and now want to shift to HD as they will now be reimbursed for the cost of HD, he said.   Considering this number of patients choosing or requiring HD, allowing them to choose HD or PD won’t likely become a problem in this short term, he said.   “The availability of HD facilities and staff is unlikely to become a huge problem in the beginning as PD can still be an option in case a number of patients still have to be put on the waiting list for HD,” he said.   And now that the cost of automated peritoneal dialysis (APD), a form of PD performed using a PD machine typically at night whilst the patient is sleeping, is covered for under the National Health Security Office’s (NHSO) Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS), many patients never want to return HD, he said.   Before the arrival of APD, patients were normally required to do PD three to four times a day, he said.   In a long term, when a higher number of new HD units will be opened in more small hospitals, he said, he is concerned that that will eventually lead to shortage of medical specialists needed for operating these new HD units.   So, in preparation for the foreseen growing demand for these specially-trained healthcare workers – namely nephrologists, vascular surgeons and nephrology nurses – the Ministry of Public Health is therefore being encouraged to begin training and hiring more of these professionals, he said.   The NST will be cooperating with the ministry in accelerating the training of these three types of healthcare professionals needed to ensure there will be enough of them by the time the demand for them rises rapidly, he said.   Dr Suchai’s other concern is the quality control of HD centres after the NHSO had previously indicated that the HD service quality inspection by the sub-committee on treatment quality certification, which was normally required upon requesting reimbursement for HD costs, would no longer be necessary.   Although the NHSO has insisted it now has treatment quality inspection teams to take over the job from the sub-committee, Dr Suchai said, he still believes it will be best for the NHSO and all other medical professional associations concerned to further discuss the matter and find the best solution.   As for its part, the NST now aims to train staff at existing HD centres on how to provide advice to kidney patients as to what will be most suitable for them when it comes to choosing kidney dialysis, he said.   Patients should be informed properly about both advantages and disadvantages of each type of kidney dialysis, in order to help them make the right decision in choosing the type of kidney dialysis that is most suitable for them, he said.   He suggested that the NHSO should require every kidney patient to sign a document to acknowledge that they have been provided with sufficient advice before choosing any types of kidney dialysis.   Kidney patients and their doctors will together decide what type of kidney dialysis is most suitable for each them in terms of such as lifestyle and their living environment, said Assoc Prof Dr Surasak Kantachuvesiri, president of the NST.   Previously when PD was designated as the first option, many of those kidney patients who felt they weren’t really ready to do PD at home and were afraid of possible infections had to pay for their decisions to choose HD over PD, he said.   “Over a decade ago, we had launched the PD First policy because there weren’t sufficient HD units and staff to serve all patients at the same time. So they weren’t allowed to choose HD over PD back then,” he said.   “The burden of having to pay for HD services on their own was enormous indeed for many patients,” he said.   And since HD is now made a choice for kidney patients under the UCS, training enough healthcare professionals required to operate more HD centres to come will be the key factor to succeed in the implementation of this new policy, he said.   Opening a new HD centre may not take much time but training these healthcare professionals specifically to keep up with the growing demand for them at new HD centres does take time, he said.   After all, he said, he actually expects the transition from PD to HD to be very gradual, especially in remote areas where there still aren’t HD units to serve those patients interested in shifting from PD to HD.   Those kidney patients who already have chosen HD over PD and pay for its costs out of their own pocket will be the very first group to immediately benefit from this change in the HD cost reimbursing policy, he said.   ///    "
64,64, Cancer screening tests provided to Thais   Thu 10 Febuary 2022  ,"  Cancer screening tests provided to Thais   Cancer is a major burden of disease around the world. According to the World Health Organization, it is the second leading cause of death globally, accounting for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018.   To combat cancer, the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) and the World Health Organization have marked ""World Cancer Day"" on 4 Feb to raise awareness of the disease and to encourage its prevention, detection, and treatment.   In Thailand, the government has put efforts and resources into tackling and preventing cancer. The National Cancer Institute of Thailand reported that more than 139,000 new cancer cases were detected each year from 2016 to 2018, or 381 cases per day.   More than 84,000 people die from cancer each year.   The five most common cancer among Thais are liver cancer and cholangiocarcinoma, breast cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and cervical cancer.   ""Some types of cancer can be cured if they are early detected, prompting the Thai government to introduce cancer screening tests in its three healthcare schemes Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS), Social Security Scheme, and Civil Servant Medical Benefits,"" said Dr Jadej Thammatacharee, secretary-general of National Health Security Office (NHSO) managing the UCS fund.    ""Once the tests show the risk of cancer, individuals will receive diagnostic tests and treatment if the tests confirm them having the disease.""   In 2022, in collaboration with the NHSO, the government will focus on a case-finding strategy that targets providing screening tests for population groups at risk for cancer.   Here are the three types of cancers highlighted in the government's healthcare schemes.   Cervical cancer   Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women in Thailand after breast cancer. It can often be found early and even prevented by regular screening tests.   To encourage Thai women to have regular tests, the NHSO has pushed to include three types of cervical cancer screening tests in the government's healthcare schemes.   These include pap smear (by collecting cells from cervix), visual inspection with acetic acid (by inserting speculum in cervix and physicians having naked-eye examination), and HPV DNA Test (by collecting cells and examining in laboratories for the genetic material of HPV.)   These tests are recommended by the Royal Thai College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Every woman should get a test once every five years.   The NHSO will provide tests to three million women in 2022, or around 20% of the female population in Thailand.   In 2017, the NHSO started introducing the HPV vaccine in the government's healthcare benefits, in which girls are eligible to get free vaccines when they reach grade five.   Colorectal cancer   Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer among Thais.    Since 2018, fecal immunochemical test (FIT) has been included in the government's healthcare benefits. It tests for hidden blood in the stool, which shows an early sign of cancer.   Thais aged between 50 and 70 are eligible for getting free tests once every two years. If their test results are positive, doctors will provide them with a diagnostic colonoscopy.   The NHSO has set a target to provide FIT to 1.7 million people in 2022, or around 10% of the target groups.   Oral cancer  Oral cancer screening test is a new medical benefit introduced in the government's three healthcare schemes this year.   Thais over 40 years old can request one test every year, which is recommended by the Public Health Ministry's Department of Health, Royal College of Dental Surgeons, and the Royal College of Otolaryngologists-Head and Neck Surgeons of Thailand.   Around 2.2 million people, or 30% of the target population, will receive the tests throughout this year, costing approximately 29 million baht.   The NHSO considers this an investment in people's health because oral cancer can be cured if detected at an early stage. Those who are treated can continue everyday lives and make a return to the Thai economy.   /////////////////////    "
65,65, Free antenatal care (ANC) for pregnant women and partners    Wed 09 Febuary 2022  ,"  Free antenatal care (ANC) for pregnant women and partners    Thai pregnant women can access free ‘quality antenatal care (ANC)’ under the Universal Healthcare Coverage (UHC) comprising the government’s three healthcare schemes Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS), Social Security Scheme, and Civil Servant Medical Benefits.   “Providing healthcare to babies since they are in the mothers’ wombs is very important for ensuring their good health, quality growth, and cognitive development when they grow up,” said Dr Jadej Thammatacharee, secretary-general of National Health Security Office (NHSO) overseeing the UCS.   “This will lead them to have happy and successful lives. Because they are healthy and productive, and able to develop skills and critical thinking necessary for living and working in adulthood.”     The NHSO has introduced antenatal care in the UCS benefits package since its introduction in 2002. The healthcare benefits for pregnant women have been continually improved throughout the years.   Currently, pregnant women can request antenatal care in eight hospital visits, increasing from five in 2016.   The NHSO adjusted the reimbursement system in 2019 by introducing a fee schedule payment to cover the cost incurred during antenatal care, allowing hospital operators to be flexible in healthcare provisions.   The benefits cover mothers’ pregnancy tests, medical consulting, medical check-ups, ultrasounds, mental health, and dental care. The others include;    Glucose level test for the prevention of gestational diabetes in mothers. One dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine for the protection of newborns from whooping cough or pertussis.      Daily oral iron and folic acid supplementation for pregnant women preventing maternal anaemia, puerperal sepsis, low birth weight, and preterm birth.      Iodine supplementation, which is essential for healthy brain development in the fetus and young child.      Diagnosis tests for syphilis, HIV, hepatic B, thalassemia in mothers.      Complete Blood Count test and ABO typing.      Down syndrome screening during pregnancy.    From 2022 onward, partners of pregnant women can request syphilis screening tests to prevent the transmission of the disease from partners to mothers and infants.   They can also get thalassemia screening tests to assess the risks of inherited thalassemia in children.   Items in the benefits package are adopted from the Department of Health, Public Health Ministry recommendations, the Royal Thai College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and the World Health Organization.    Between 400,000 and 500,000 pregnant women get antenatal care under the UHC each year, costing around 1.2 billion baht for healthcare provisions.   “The cost is not expensive when considering the outcomes, which infants will grow up with quality life and return economic benefits to the country,” said Dr Jadej.   “We encourage pregnant women to visit hospitals and get antenatal care. They should remain to consult with medical staff from the same hospital throughout their pregnancy, which will ensure the continuity and effectiveness of care.”   //////    "
66,66, 72 rehabilitation centers launched in Saraburi   Thu 27 January 2022  ,"  72 rehabilitation centers launched in Saraburi   Saraburi Provincial Administrative Organization (PAO) launched the ""Happiness Sharing Center"" in 72 locations, providing rehabilitation therapy to local communities in 13 districts of Saraburi.     The centers are funded under the Provincial Rehabilitation Fund, the National Health Security Office (NHSO)'s initiative targeting people with disabilities, elders, and patients requiring rehabilitation therapy.   Introduced in 2009, the Provincial Rehabilitation Fund offers funding opportunities to PAOs across Thailand to improve the target population's livelihood by providing them with rehabilitation services within their communities' outreach.   Having the rehabilitation centers close to their home will ensure the consistency of physical therapy and the desired outcomes. Patients don't need to commute to hospitals, which can be costly and time-consuming and discourage them from getting regular treatment.     Thanakrit Atthasampunna, deputy chief executive of Saraburi PAO, said that the centers' launch was successful thanks to the collaboration of Saraburi PAO, the NHSO, and Saraburi Provincial Health Office.    Saraburi PAO and the NHSO have shared costs incurred from providing rehabilitation services, of which Saraburi PAO and the NHSO contributed four and 2.1 million baht, respectively.   The health facilities has provided health staff, including physiotherapists stationed at each Happiness Sharing Center, at least once a week.   Saraburi PAO has purchased the rehabilitation aids and physiotherapy equipment and distributed them to the patients who need them. It has also set up the equipment repairing center and supported local people to make equipment from used materials such as plastic bottles, coconut shells, and robes.   Dr Prasithichai Mungjit, deputy director of Saraburi Provincial Health Office, said that around six to seven patients needing rehabilitation emerge each day. Each of them requires to spend about half a year in rehabilitation therapy.   ""Currently, between five to six Happiness Sharing Centers are launched in each district, improving the chance for patients to get consistent rehabilitation therapy,"" he said.   ""Around 50 physiotherapists have worked in hospitals in our province. They can take turns to visit the centers and provide regular rehabilitation therapy to local communities.""   In early Jan, Dr Jadej Thammatacharee, the NHSO's Secretary-General, and his deputy Dr Aphichart Rodsom visited the Happiness Sharing Center at Huay Bong sub-district in Saraburi's Chalermphrakiat District.    Dr Jadej found the local community warmly welcomed the center. But he also saw room for improvement, including finding more effective ways to engage multi-stakeholders in the center's operation.      At the provincial level, multi-stakeholders are represented in the committee for managing the Provincial Rehabilitation Fund to ensure the effectiveness and transparency of the fund spending.   The stakeholders include the government officials, PAO, Tambol Administrative Organization, the NHSO, Provincial  Public Health Office, health professionals and providers, civil society, local communities, and people with disabilities and elders.   ""I believe that each rehabilitation center supported by the Provincial Rehabilitation Fund can grow and become an independent health unit in the future.   The center staff may raise more funding from different sources beyond PAOs and the NHSO,"" said Dr Jadej.    In 2022, the NHSO allocated 150 million baht to the Provincial Rehabilitation Fund and supported 58 PAOs in strengthening their capacity to manage the rehabilitation centers.    /////////////////    "
67,67, One billion baht paid to COVID-19 vaccine recipients experiencing side effects    Fri 21 January 2022  ,"  One billion baht paid to COVID-19 vaccine recipients experiencing side effects    The National Health Security Office (NHSO) has paid one billion baht compensation to nearly 10,000 people who reported adverse effects from COVID-19 vaccinations.    The NHSO Secretary-General, Dr Jadej Thammatacharee said that the no-fault compensation for COVID-19 vaccination is the Thai government’s policy, aiming to raise public confidence toward vaccines and encourage people to be vaccinated.    The government assigned the NHSO to implement the policy, including issuing a guideline for compensation eligibility, criteria, and payment system on May 16 last year. Only Thai citizens are eligible for the compensation.    As of Jan 14, there are 12,882 vaccine recipients launched complaints to claim compensation for undesired side effects. Around 74% of them or 9,551 complaints were accepted, which the NHSO paid a total of one billion baht in compensation for these cases.   Another 14.5% or 1,869 complaints do not meet the criteria for obtaining compensation. The rest or 1,462 cases are still under the NHSO committee’s scrutiny.   Nearly 20% of the complaints come from vaccine recipients in the NHSO region 13, Bangkok area and the rest are from all over the countries.   Around 52% of vaccine recipients are beneficiaries of the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS), 25% Social Security Scheme, 20% Civil Servant Medical Benefits, and the rest are covered by other healthcare schemes.   The side effects reported to the NHSO are varied, including fever, abdominal pain, nausea, rash and itching, numbness, limb weakness, phylaxis shock, and death.   The compensation rates are divided into three categories, at most 100,000 baht for a persistent injury or illness, at most 240,000 baht for losses of body parts or disabilities, and at most 400,000 baht for death or permanent disabilities.   Around 18% of the complaints fall into the third category. However, about 55% of the complaints relate to non-severe side effects.   The vaccine recipients with adverse effects can launch complaints within two years after the side effects are observed, said Dr Jadej. They can submit their complaints at health units that provide them with COVID-19 shots, provincial health offices, or the NHSO regional offices.    After the submission, the NHSO’s regional subcommittees comprising health experts and civil society will scrutinize the complaints launched in their regions and based on the no-fault compensation principle.   The result will be announced within five days after complaints are submitted to the subcommittee. If the vaccine recipients disagree with the result, they can appeal with the NHSO secretary-general within 30 days after the result announcement.   Dr Athaporn Limpanyalers , the NHSO deputy secretary-general, emphasized that applying the no-fault compensation principle means the affected vaccine recipients will promptly receive the compensation without going through investigations or proving that vaccines cause the adverse events.   “The subcommittee's scrutiny process focuses on providing vaccine recipients with quick financial assistance. Any delays will exacerbate the side effects they are coping with,” he said.  “The subcommittee will look at their past medical records and side effect timelines, and consider the amount of compensation on a case-by-case basis.”   Since 2002, the NHSO has applied the no-fault compensation principle in the UCS, in which beneficiaries can claim compensation for medical errors without investigation that may span months to years.   The principle is pinned in section 41 of the National Health Security Act 2002, which set up the direction for the NHSO in striding toward Universal Health Coverage in Thailand.   ///////////////     "
68,68, HITAP outlines six new challenges facing NHSO in further improvement of UCS   Mon 20 December 2021  ,"  HITAP outlines six new challenges facing NHSO in further improvement of UCS  Nineteen years have passed since its establishment, the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) has now been recognised as a valuable asset of the nation, considering its numerous successes achieved in the past years.  Findings from a recent survey by the National Statistical Office of Thailand, for instance, have demonstrated that the UCS, better known as the 30 baht scheme, has stood out among the various populist projects being implemented in the past 25 years in Thailand.  At least one member of the families has been benefiting from this healthcare policy because he or she has more money left for spending on other household expenses since the launch of the healthcare scheme that helps many people save a lot of money they previously before the UCS came spent on healthcare, said Dr Yot Teerawattananon, chief of the Health Intervention and Technology Assessment Program (HITAP).  The continuous development of the UCS in the past 19 years, he said, is also found to have helped reduce disparities in healthcare benefits offered to the people under this healthcare scheme and the Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme (CSMBS).  The development of the UCS’ core benefit package in particular has won international recognition and been taken as a model for many countries to learn from, he said, adding that what makes the development of the UCS’ benefit package so special is public participation in the development.  Instead of simply assuming as to what else should be included into the scheme’s benefit package, the National Health Security Office (NHSO) always begins with listening to opinions from all parties concerned, compiling these opinions as the input into its next development of the scheme’s benefit package and then prioritising the proposed changes before translating words into action, he said.  “Some of the healthcare benefits the NHSO is offering under the UCS have amazed my foreign friends as to how advanced they are. Kidney dialysis at home, for one, is highly interesting for these friends of mine,” he said.   “During the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients with kidney failure in Europe have died due to a sudden lack of access to kidney dialysis services, while Thai kidney patients can continue with their peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis as usual,” he said.  The NHSO’ s implementation of a programme to distribute medications to the UCS patients either through the scheme’s network of pharmacies or by post has also won recognition as being a creative approach to keep the healthcare system running as usual as possible during the past COVID-19 crisis, he said.  Despite these notable successes, the UCS still has more challenges, even more significant, to cope with in the years to come. In case of the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, a new challenge has already emerged and is now facing most low-income countries alike. It is a new drug that the entire world is relying on to save lives of the people from the disease no matter how expensive the drug is.  While the NHSO is pondering as to what could be the best solution to address this emerging challenge, it has learned that the British government has secured an agreement with a pharmaceutical company, in which the former agrees to pay the latter a fixed amount of money for annual supplies of antibiotics, said Dr Yot.  This drug procurement option is aimed at ensuring the British people’s access to antibiotics, which the NHSO is contemplating whether it will be actually suitable for Thailand or not, he said.  And learning from the NHSO’s past experience in handling COVID-19, HITAP has identified six key challenges the NHSO will be encountering following waves of the COVID-19 epidemic.  First, as work incentive for those healthcare workers who weren’t civil servants before COVID-19 came, the government had in 2021 resolved to hire about 30,000 of them as civil servants, which is worried to in a way result in a surge in fixed labour costs in the UCS in the long run because salaries of these new civil servants are included into the capitation budget allocated under the UCS.  Second, as global warming, blamed for more incidents of natural disasters and emerging diseases, is posting a significant threat to the global public health, the NHSO will have to take this challenge into consideration when next adjusting the UCS’ benefit package.   Third, as the aging society has become a new public health challenge in Thailand, the UCS will inevitably be impacted by a rise in healthcare burdens associated with population aging. So, it’s important for the healthcare scheme to plan ahead as to how to cope with this major change.  Fourth, although the local administrative organisations’ increasing roles in managing the state’s healthcare budget at a community level are seen as an opportunity for the NHSO to have more partners in further developing the UCS’ primary care system, this can become a real challenge at the same time.  Fifth, the abovementioned high prices of new drugs are another challenge now facing the UCS. More of such extremely expensive yet necessary medications are expected to be rolled out later, one of which may cost an extra cost of treatment of between 10 million baht and 100 million baht.  Last, as humanitarian medicine is being incorporated into Thailand’s healthcare system, the need to both upskill healthcare workers under the UCS and support them to reskill is seen as the other major challenge the UCS will have to deal with. ///    .           "
69,69, Disease prevention and health promotion always crucial for cost cutting: TDRI   Mon 20 December 2021  ,"  Disease prevention and health promotion always crucial for cost cutting: TDRI  One important reason why the capitation budget system has been adopted in the implementation of the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) is it is believed to provide incentive for healthcare providers to pay more attention to promoting good health of the people and preventing them from developing preventable health problems.   The reason is disease prevention and health promotion are altogether considered a key mechanism for primary care units to keep their healthcare costs as low as possible so that they have enough money for paying their other costs.   That is an important common suggestion by those health economists researching into and evaluating the National Health Security Office’s (NHSO) operating of the UCS and attempts to streamline the healthcare scheme, which has been heard from time to time over the past 19 years.  Marking the 19th anniversary of the NHSO, Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI), for one, has stressed the need for the NHSO to continue focusing on preventing chronic diseases and injuries from accidents.  And while being regarded as two major challenges facing the NHSO’s management of the UCS’ annual budget, both costs of chronic diseases associated with population aging and costs of treating the people injured in accidents can actually be curtailed, said Worawan Chandoevwit, an advisor on social security at the TDRI.  Thailand's elderly population is growing rapidly, according to various studies including ones by the TDRI.  The country is already considered an ""ageing"" society, meaning 10% of the population is aged 60 and over, since 2005. It is transitioning to an ""aged"" society, with those aged 60 and over set to account for 20% of the population this year.  Thailand's trajectory sees it becoming a ""super-aged"" society in 2031, where those aged 60 and over make up 28% of the population.  These demographics present great challenges for policymakers and demand an urgency in planning.  The NHSO will likely have more money left for funding an inclusion of more healthcare benefits into the UCS’s core benefit package if it can successfully lower these costs with the help of disease prevention and health promotion, which actually concern not only the NHSO but also several other partners, said  Dr. Worawan.   Together with these partners, the NHSO is encouraged to adopt a proactive working approach when working to promote good health and prevent chronic diseases, she said.  From an economist’s perspective, he said, first of all strong determination by most members of the public to have better health is required and it will play a crucial role in the NHSO’s effort to succeed in promoting good health and preventing diseases.   A recent survey by the National Statistical Office of Thailand has found that what most Thai people now value over other things, even good income, is good health, he said, adding that this clearly demonstrates a positive impact of the UCS on the attitude of the people about their health and their happiness and satisfaction towards their lives.  Secondly, a slight rise in the state’s healthcare spending which has in return brought down the household spending on healthcare by about five times the increase is the evidence that the UCS is a cost-effective mechanism for improving the public health, she said.  “Many people now have more money left for paying their other household expenses, thanks to the UCS,” she said.  Before the UCS came in 2002, the healthcare spending accounted for about 35% of all household expenses, while 17 years later the household healthcare spending has decreased by 25% to only about 10% of all household expenses, during which the state’s healthcare spending rose by only between 5% and 6%, she said.  Speaking of healthcare expenditures, she said, in her point of view it is not really accurate to base the calculation of the country’s ideal healthcare budget mainly on the nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  “Before COVID-19 it might be alright to compare healthcare costs under the UCS with GDP,” she said.  However, now that Thailand still has to live with COVID-19, which has severely damaged the economy and caused costs of healthcare under the UCS as well as the country’s entire healthcare system to surge, it may no longer be practical to keep calculating the healthcare budget for the UCS based on GDP, she said.  In terms of social disparities, she said, disparities in the country’s healthcare system have been reduced considerably especially when compared with other systems including the education system during the past years of the UCS’ operations, she said.  Despite this achievement, the remaining disparities in healthcare benefits and expenses among all existing healthcare schemes still need to be eliminated to improve equality in the people’s healthcare rights no matter which scheme they are in, she said.  “Hopefully, in the next 10 to 20 years from now patients will no longer be asked under which healthcare scheme they are registered before they will be given care by doctors,” she said.  ///         "
70,70, UHC has well prepared Thailand for coping with COVID-19   Mon 20 December 2021  ,"   UHC has well prepared Thailand for coping with COVID-19  Claiming more than 5.3 million lives worldwide so far, the COVID-19 pandemic is now seen as one of the world’s most challenging health threats. And how well each country can cope with the pandemic is a testament to how effective the healthcare system of each nation actually is when all of a sudden encountering this major health crisis.   Many countries have seen their healthcare systems being overwhelmed by a surge in number of COVID-19 infected patients requiring life-saving treatment and care. And sad but true even those developed countries with a world leading healthcare system before the pandemic were left with no choice but to choose who were to be given the treatment and who would have to wait even though they couldn’t actually wait.  The world has learned two key lessons from dealing with COVID-19 over the past two years, said Dr Jos Vandelaer, the WHO Representative to Thailand, addressing a seminar entitled “UHC: The key system to fight COVID-19 and build back better”.  The seminar was jointly organised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the National Health Security Office (NHSO) at the Ministry of Public Health, marking the International Universal Health Coverage Day on Dec 12, 2021.  In his point of view, one important lesson is many countries around the world weren’t really ready for handling the pandemic despite a warning sign that the new coronavirus would likely trigger a new pandemic when it started spreading in China by late 2019.  A second important lesson learned is countries with a strong healthcare system are more capable of managing to control an outbreak of the coronavirus than those with a less strong healthcare system, said Dr Vandelaer.  Not only being more capable of coping with a COVID-19 epidemic, countries with a significant healthcare system can also manage to ensure the continuity of other healthcare services while dealing with COVID-19 infections, he said.  “Speaking of health security, we certainly are referring to the ability to cope well with a crisis like an outbreak, which in this case means having universal health coverage,” he said. “Universal health coverage comprises three elements, namely access to services, affordable prices and quality of services. Thailand has all these three components.”  The country has sufficient funds to invest in the development of the public health infrastructure, a strong healthcare workforce, enough budget and an efficient supply chain to prepare to cope with any new outbreaks, he said.  Dr Phusit Prakongsai, a health promotion expert with the Office of Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Public Health, meanwhile, pointed out that there are six factors contributing to Thailand’s success in containing COVID-19.  They are strong leadership in all organisations making decisions based on scientific evidence, the government’s management system for fast adapting to a changing situation, adequate public health resources, previous experiences in handling outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus, continuity of and transparency in communication with the public, and public participation in containing the spread of the virus, he said.   For Dr Jadej Thammatacharee, secretary-general of the NHSO, COVID-19 has in a way led to the NHSO and all other healthcare units being required to adjust the way they work such as in providing healthcare to all COVID-19 patients free of charge in disregard of their healthcare rights.  No matter which healthcare scheme these patients are registered in, they can receive free treatment and care for COVID-19 at the hospitals receiving reimbursement from the NHSO for the healthcare services they offer to these patients.  Other healthcare innovations the NHSO has created or adopted for use during the past waves of the COVID-19 outbreak in Thailand include telemedicine and delivering medications to patients by mail, which are both aimed at maintaining patients’ access to necessary healthcare while they have to maintain social distancing as part of the government’s COVID-19 restrictions, said Dr Jadej.  Initially, the NHSO didn’t have its own budget to fund all these efforts to ensure public access to necessary healthcare during the coronavirus outbreak, he said, adding that the government had later approved an additional budget to finance the inclusion of additional healthcare benefits the NHSO is offering under its universal coverage scheme to both COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients.  Despite all these achievements, more challenges remain as the NHSO continues working towards improving the country’s healthcare system, he said.  Among them is the need to further develop a financial mechanism in preparation for handling future outbreaks and bring in place an integrated database containing health data from all healthcare schemes, he said.  Takahiro Morita, chief representative of Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) Thailand Office, meanwhile, pointed to the importance of transnational cooperation in a fight against a pandemic.  JICA, for one, has long been working together with Thailand in supporting the kingdom to build a strong healthcare system and campaigning to raise awareness about the importance of building up universal health coverage through international forums, he said.  In case of the COVID-19 outbreak, he said, the Japanese government has supported Thailand to cope better with the outbreak such as by donating more than 2 million doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine and a number of oxygen generators for patients to Thailand.   Japanese experts and their Thai counterparts are also working together in developing a new disease diagnostic system, he said. ///       "
71,71, Healthcare service upgrades bring convenience access for all members   Wed 24 November 2021  ," Healthcare service upgrades bring convenience access for all members    Dr Jadej Thammatacharee, secretary-general of the NHSO      About half a year since the National Health Security Office (NHSO) has begun enhancing four healthcare services under the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS), it has found these efforts to improve the healthcare services are paying off.  These service improvements are the brainchild of Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirukul.   Approved by the National Health Security Board on Oct 5, 2020, the first service enhancement is more flexibility allowed for patients to visit physicians at any primary care units in the same network of UCS healthcare providers in Bangkok, the surrounding provinces and the National Health Security Office Region 9 in Nakhon Ratchasima.  From Jan 1, 2021 when this change was implemented until April 30, 2021, healthcare services have been requested and provided under this new option 230,379 times and without any complaint received.  The change has later been adopted in the NHSO Region 7 in Khon Kaen and the NHSO Region 8 in Udon Thani since March 1, 2021, while the NHSO Region 10 began implementing the same change from April 1, 2021.  The second change is the cancellation of an old regulation requiring patients admitted for treatment in the hospital for a long period to submit a new referral document, normally issued by their registered primary care units, every three months until they are discharged from the hospital.  The old regulation was found to be an avoidable burden for relatives of these patients as they normally have to travel back and forth between the hospital and the primary care unit every three months simply to get a single document.  So, to ensure the continuity of treatment for these patients, the NHSO now allows them to identify themselves throughout the course of treatment with a single document – their ID card. And while the NHSO is responsible for reimbursing these hospitals for the treatment costs, these healthcare facilities handle referral documents and medical records of the patients for them.  The implementation of this change began on Nov 1, 2020 in the NHSO Region 9 in Nakhon Ratchasima and later on Jan 1, 2021in Bangkok and the surrounding provinces.  As of April 30, 2021, the NHSO Region 9 had recorded that patients and their relatives were spared from having to travel all the way to get a new referral document on a total of 82,599 occasions. No complaints have been received about this new regulation so far.  Following this success in implementing the change, the NHSO now intends to expand the implementation of this specific service improvement countrywide in 2022.  The third service upgrade deals with allowing cancer patients to seek medical services at any cancer-treating hospitals within the designed zone, to improve access to and the speeds of cancer treatment, which are crucial for improving the outcome of the treatment.    Any patients under the UCS who are diagnosed with cancer will be given a code for certifying their diagnoses and medical history for use when contacting a cancer-treating hospital of their choice through three channels, namely the NHSO’s Hotline No.1330, the NHSO’s mobile application and contacting these cancer-treating hospitals directly.  Starting on Jan 1, 2021, several treatment options may apply where appropriate, namely telehealth, telephamarcy and home chemotherapy. The Department of Medical Sciences, Ministry of Public Health has supported the implementation of this healthcare service enhancement by arranging a database of hospitals capable of treating cancer.  As of April 30, 2021, a total of 192 such cancer-treating hospitals joined this cancer treatment programme. And while cancer treatment has been provided 263,486 times to 137,736 patients at out-patient wards during the same period, 46,655 times (16.58%) were treatment offered under the new cancer treatment option.  And of all 99,915 times that cancer treatment was provided to 81,045 patients at in-patient wards, 10,128 (10.13%) were services offered under the new cancer treatment programme, in which UCS patients aren’t charged for the treatment.  The last healthcare improvement implemented is that the people registered under the UCS no longer are required to wait up to 15 days when they request to change their registered primary care units from one to another. Before this change, they normally were required to wait until the 15th or the 28th of each month until their requests took effect, which was seen as a hindrance to patients as they were unable to immediately seek healthcare services at the new primary care unit as they wanted to such as in case they have moved to live in a new area.  So, to accommodate the change, the NHSO has developed the primary care unit registration system which allows users to submit their own requests to change the primary care unit via a smartphone application or the website.  Such requests are normally processed and approved in one day and each patient is allowed to change their registered primary care units four times a year, starting Jan 1, 2021.  As of April 30, 2021, a total of 537,439 requests to change a registered primary care unit were received, 485,595 (92%) were made through the primary care units, while 51,844 (8%) requests were received through the NHSO’s application. On 29,945 occasions (7.21%) patients sought a healthcare service at a new primary care unit as soon as their new registration was approved.  “From this report of the outcome of the four service enhancements, which are the public health minister’s policy, they have brought about a lot more convenience to patients,” said Dr Jadej Thammatacharee, secretary-general of the NHSO.  “Access [to these four healthcare services] has also improved considerably in the areas where these changes were piloted,” he said. “The implementation of the change to stop requiring referral documents in particular will be expanded to cover all parts of the country in 2022.”  More information regarding these four areas of healthcare service improvement may be obtained through the NHSO’s Hotline No.1330, Line ID “@nhso” or https://line.ee/zzn3pU6.   ////////        "
72,72, New regulation to prevent extra billing.   Tue 16 November 2021  ,"          New regulation to prevent extra billing.   The National Health Security Office (NHSO) pushed forward a regulation to prevent extra billing for medical services.  On November 1, the NHSO board chaired by Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul endorsed the drafted regulation titled categories and scope of public health services 2021, which clarifies a list of health service fees covered under the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS).  The drafted regulation results from an extensive review of existing regulations, which was led by the NHSO's subcommittee on categories and scope of health services.  Dr Prasobsri Ungthavorn, the subcommittee chairman, said that the subcommittee had reviewed 31 relevant regulations implemented since 2003, after Thailand introduced UCS successfully.   The subcommittee re-categorized health services and combined those regulations into one, to make it is more understandable for hospital operators and UCS beneficiaries.   The draft put health services covered by the UCS into 13 categories, health promotion and disease prevention; disease diagnosis; maternal care; medical treatment; drug, medical equipment, and artificial organs; childbirth; admission in care units; newborn care; ambulance and transportation services; transportation for people with disabilities; physical and mental rehabilitation, Thai traditional and alternative medicines; and necessary health services listed by the NHSO.  Health service fees that are not covered include; aesthetic treatment; unnecessary diagnosis and treatment; treatment at an experimental stage; organ transplantation, and health services that the NHSO excludes.  Dr Prasobsri added that there are other health services that the UCS does not cover, such as those that require a copayment.   UCS beneficiaries will be charged if they request health services from health units where they don't register, except having transferal documents or being considered as emergency cases.   The drafted regulation also adds new items eligible for UCS coverage, including specific drug and substance addiction treatment; health services relating to car accidents; infertility treatment (exclude surrogacy); and treatment requiring more than 180 days of admission.  NHSO expects the drafted regulation to be announced on the Royal Thai Government Gazette soon. "
73,73, COVID-19 pandemic in india: Challenges and a glimpse of hope   Mon 25 October 2021  ,"  COVID-19 pandemic in India: Challenges and a glimpse of hope    Since April, India has been in the second wave of COVID-19, with the brutal consequences of skyrocketing infections, increasing deaths, and medical supply shortage.    Amid the chaos, Dr Gagandeep Kang, an Indian microbiologist and virologist at the Department of Gastrointestinal Sciences, the Christian Medical College in India's Vellore city, has tracked the national and state governments' progress in fighting against the pandemic.   Spoke at an online webinar on India's lesson learned in the COVID-19 pandemic, held by the Health Intervention and Technology Assessment Program (HITAP) on October 14, Dr Gang told the several challenges faced by her country.   Those include testing inaccessibility, limited manufacturing and regulatory capacity in the medical field, misinformation, and political fracture that influence the country's ability to manage the pandemic effectively.    But she also found hope in some Indian states that increase people's immunity and vaccination despite all the challenges and overwhelming healthcare system.   Limitation on testing  Over 34 million cumulative COVID-19 cases and around 450,000 deaths were reported in mid-October. The country is ranked second and third for countries with the highest cumulative infections and death, respectively.    However, the actual numbers of deaths are unknown, said Dr Kang, also a fellow of the Royal Society. Estimates suggest that there were up to 10 times more COVID-19 relevant deaths than were officially recorded.    That's because mild and asymptomatic cases are less likely to be detected, or infectious people can't reach out to testing in the government's surveillance systems.    Since May last year, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has conducted nationwide serosurveys, which examines the percentage of the population exposed to the virus.   Its first serosurvey, conducted between May and June last year when the country was under the stringent lockdown, found that 0.73% of adults aged over 18 years from 21 states had COVID-19 antibodies---meaning the majority of the Indian population were at risk of exposing to the virus. Those living in urban slums were one of the most risks.    ""It was a mess last year when it came to testing. There was a lot of fraud. One of the first things to do with infectious disease is to increase the ability to diagnose. Instead, we had a command and control structure in which we had to get permission to perform testing, and we wouldn't be allowed to test in many situations,"" said Dr Kang.    ""The reason for that was the government wanted to control how many cases were reported. India refused to admit that the disease was prevalent in the population.""    Boosting immunization However, the fourth serosurvey, conducted in 70 districts between June and July this year, offered a glimpse of hope as the percentage increased to 67.6% after the Indian government started a mass vaccination program in January.    It also showed that at least 400 million people, or nearly a third of India's 1.4 billion population, were still unprotected against the infection.    ""On top of more than 67% seropositivity, we also have to recognize that India has been giving out almost a billion doses of vaccines. Our experience in the last four months with boosting immunization and vaccination will push the 67% to a higher percentage,"" said Dr Kang.   ""I don't think we will have a widespread transmission and increase in cases as we saw during the second wave.""   What will likely happen is the transmission within families or population groups that are continually susceptible to infection. If there are new highly contagious variants, she said, the arrival of the third wave is possible.    India has also strengthened its genomic surveillance since the pandemic broke out.    In December last year, The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Department of Biotechnology, ICMR, and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research jointly established the ""Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG).""   It is a network of multi-laboratory and agency forming up to monitor COVID-19 genomic variations. It aims to understand how the virus spreads and evolves and provides information to aid public health response.    Quality remains an issue Challenges arose along the way of fighting against the pandemic, including the manufacturing quality in the medical field.   ""India has had a huge focus on essentially self-reliance on making its own diagnosis tests, ventilators, and PPE [Personal Protective Equipment.] Because of the shortage of supplies due to the lockdown and international supply chain disruption,"" said Dr Kang.    ""While manufacturers have been ramping up for diagnosis, the quality remains an issue. The standard for validation remains an issue too. In addition to strengthening manufacturing capacity, India also has to strengthen regulatory capacity and process that policymakers frequently are not willing to apply.""   Quality is also an issue for hospitals, each of which has different levels of equipment and staff availability. Public health responses among state governments are also varied depending on their policies and available resources, creating geographically unequal access to testing and treatment among Indian people.    At an early stage of the pandemic, information on COVID-19 infection and vaccination did not penetrate throughout the population, leaving spaces for inaccurate information to circulate.   India worked with UNICEF to prepare a guideline for communication strategy. Though it is generally effective, the lack of transparency in policy-making hampers the level of its effectiveness.     ""The government has tried very hard to communicate with people but the basis of some policy decisions has been unclear. We discussed some of the issues around how you make the decision on who [provides] the test and why you test, what kind of drugs are used, and when vaccines should be given to people,"" said Dr Kang.   ""If there were transparency in policy-making, overall communication around COVID-19 would have been stronger with more cooperation from the communities.""      Political fracture In India, public health response is managed by the state governments while the national policy comes from the central government -- the political system that can cause misunderstanding and mistrust between central decision-makers and local administrations in the context of lagging transparency.     Some state governments reported high infection and fatality rates and were targeted by the government for doing a bad job in controlling the spread of the virus. But the reality is otherwise, said Dr Kang. The high rates reflect their good surveillance and reporting system.    Kerala, a state on India's tropical Malabar Coast, has reported between 50% and 60% of cases in India since July.    But the serosurveys found the state had increased the immunization rate from 0.33% of the population in May last year to over 42% in a year later, resulting in the state's consistent effort to vaccinate people. By mid-October, more than 70% of the Kerala population were vaccinated, higher than the national vaccination rate at 50% of population.     ""There is at least one state that does a good job in flattering the curb. It's possible to do a good thing even within the [political] fractured structure,"" she said.   ""Overall, because we had a bad time in India during the second wave, we actually are in a not too bad position today. We still need to be watchful. We still have a lot to do.""   ///////////////////////                                                                                                                                                          "
74,74, Four orphan drugs added to the national drug list.   Wed 25 August 2021  ,"   Four orphan drugs added to the national drug list.               Four orphan drugs will be added to Thailand's national drug list to ensure patients' access to medicines for rare diseases.             On Aug 2, the National Health Security Board approved in principle the inclusion of the drugs in category E(2) , a subcategory of drugs under the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM).             category E(2) includes the orphan drug list and the target priority medicines’ policy list in order to organise the highest level of accessible and equitable drug possible and protect public safety. The orphan drugs required in a few numbers of patients. The prescription of these drugs requires special expertise or involves advancing technology, ""and"" their prices are high or costly for the society.              In addition, doctors must prescribe these drugs under an authorized system monitored by relevant government offices, including the National Health Security Office (NHSO), Comptroller General's Department, Ministry of Finance, Social Security Office, Ministry of Labours.             Dr Jakkrit Ngowsiri, the NHSO deputy secretary-general, revealed that the four drugs are: Imatinib, an oral chemotherapy medication used in cancer treatment.             Dasatinib, a medication used for the treatment of certain cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.             Tocilizumab, an immunosuppressive drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis which is a severe form of arthritis in children.               Ceftazidime/avibactam, a medication used for the treatment of bacterial infections.  Imatinib and Dasatinib will be prescribed to child patients with Philadelphia Chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ALL), a rare subtype of the most common childhood cancer.              Tocilizumab will be used in child patients aged more than two years who have systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis and whose conditions are not improved with other types of medical treatments.               Ceftazidime/avibactam will be provided to patients with Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae who have resistance to colistin, an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections.              Dr Jakkrit said the availability of these drugs would save the lives of at least 316 patients covered by the Universal Coverage Scheme.              The NHSO will procure the drugs, cost around 77 million baht, and distribute them to hospitals treating these patients.  "
75,75," Every province will receive at least 40,000 antigen test kits.   Fri 13 August 2021  ","  Every province will receive at least 40,000 antigen test kits.              National Health Security Office (NHSO) has partnered with Public Health Ministry and Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO) to distribute 8.5 million COVID-19 antigen test kits (ATK) to hospitals and pharmacies across Thailand.               The distribution follows the NHSO board's approval of the test kits' procurement on August 4.  Dr Kornchakoch Limsommut from the Public Health Ministry's Office of the Permanent Secretary said that ATK would be distributed to every province within a week after the NHSO obtained the test kits.              Each province will receive at least 40,000 units of ATK by the end of September. However, some provinces will get more units if they have a larger local population and higher prevalence of the coronavirus.              Around 1.5 million units will be reserved for emergency situations, such as the detection of new clusters, that require the quick dispatch of the test kits to affected areas.               Dr Kriddhiya Sriprasert, a senior advisor for the NHSO, said that the ATK procurement was proceeded by the GPO while the NHSO provided the funding.              When the test kits are in the GPO's hand, its staff will send them to provincial public health offices and Bangkok's Health Department, which will then pass ATK to local hospitals and pharmacies.             When handing ATKs to users, health workers must verify their authentication codes and provide instructions to the users. The NHSO will cover 10 baht per test kit to offset health workers' times in assisting users to conduct the tests.             ""If they get positive results, they should go into home isolation or community isolation. However, they will require to have RT-PCR tests if they want to join the community isolation program,"" said Dr Kriddhiya.             ""If their RT-PCR test results are negative, they should follow health workers' guidance and retest under the Public Health Ministry's guideline.""              The NHSO will involve local pharmacies and private clinics in the ATK distribution plan, added Secretary-General Dr Jadej Thammatach-aree.              His organization has established strong networks with pharmacies and private clinics which have participated in the NHSO's previous programs, including medicine home delivery and the COVID-19 home isolation program.             ""We are planning to engage pharmacists at local drug stores by asking them to provide advice to people with ATK's positive tests. The pharmacists can alert local hospitals or give the instruction on how the patients can isolate at home,"" he said.               ""The NHSO will work with the Public Health Ministry and the GPO to distribute ATK to high-risk populations. We will assess the situation at the end of September and conclude if we purchase more ATK.              Rungpetch Sakulbamrungsil, the GPO's representative, suggested that the NHSO display the list of local pharmacies, their locations, and contacts on its website or mobile application. This will allow people to reach out to the pharmacists for advice on using ATK and performing home isolation.              The pharmacists can arrange online consultants for the COVID-19 patients who may need support under home isolation.             In addition, the NHSO will procure 27 million tablets of anti-viral Favipiravir to assure the availability of the drug for coronavirus patients.

76,76," COVID-19 vaccines, medicines, test kits added to UCS.   Mon 09 August 2021  ","    COVID-19 vaccines, medicines, test kits added to UCS.              COVID-19 vaccines, medicines, test kits, and medical supplies are added to the benefits package of the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS).              The National Health Security Board approved the new items on Aug 2, under the fast-track approval channel that aims to curb the spread of the coronavirus.                Dr Jadej Thammatach-aree, the NHSO secretary-general, said that this approval of UCS’ new benefits would allow NHSO to act faster in procuring and distributing medicines and medical supplies to health providers.              Previously, the NHSO was barred from doing that by the budget and procurement rules. With the introduction of the anti-viral drug favipiravir in UCS’s benefits package, for example, the NHSO will be legitimated to purchase 27 million tablets of the drug to treat COVID-19 patients.              The purchase, which cost around 891 million baht, will be proceeded within this year. The NHSO has also planned to purchase more tablets next year to prevent the shortage of drugs for treating COVID-19 patients.             This will add up to the Public Health Ministry’s procurement of 50 million tablets of favipiravir in Sep.     "
77,77, 8.5 million antigen test kits to be offered for free   Thu 22 July 2021  ,"   8.5 million antigen test kits to be offered for free             National Health Security Office (NHSO) plans to purchase more than 8.5 million antigen test kits and hand them to people.                The plan was endorsed by the NHSO board chaired by Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul during its meeting on 19 July. The purchase, equivalent to one billion baht, will be funded by the budget under the Thai government's emergency loan decree.              Anutin said that the surge of COVID-19 cases increased the demand for antigen test kits, which can perform the testing results faster and easier than RT-CPR tests.              Rajavithi hospital network is assigned to work with the Government Pharmaceutical Organization to find suppliers.              After the purchase, the NHSO will distribute the devices to both Thais and migrant workers for free. The distribution may be done through health facilities.                          Dr Jadej Thammathach-Aree, the NHSO secretary-general, said that the NHSO would obtain antigen test kits within August and distribute them in September this year.              During the meeting, the NHSO board agreed to pay compensation to health workers who collect COVID-19 victims' bodies-- the job that is considered high risk for their health.              A health worker will receive 2,500 baht per collecting one body. This fund will also cover personal protective equipment worn by a health worker and a body bag for the decease.              In addition, the NHSO board approved the amendment of its regulation to allow the government's healthcare schemes beneficiaries to request COVID-19 health promotion and disease prevention services from any health facilities. The services include vaccination and hospital quarantine. Previously, patients must get the services from their registered hospitals only.    "
78,78, NHSO pays medical expenses for mild COVID-19 cases.   Tue 20 July 2021  ,"   NHSO pays medical expenses for mild COVID-19 cases.              National Health Security Office (NHSO) supports private clinics and primary care units to provide care to COVID-19 patients under home and community isolation in Bangkok.              On July 14, the NHSO staff arranged a virtual meeting with the representatives of clinics and primary care units to prepare the back-office operation, including the claim reimbursement system and patients records and transfer management.             The meeting was joined by more than 490 people, including the Public Health Ministry representatives, health experts, and non-governmental organizations.             Home and community isolation is a program for caring and monitoring COVID-19 patients who show asymptomatic or mild symptoms. They can recover by getting primary care in isolation, either at home or in community facilities.              Under the program, the medical staff of clinics and primary care units will contact the patients and provide them medical supplies, food, and regular virtual consultation.              The NHSO will reimburse the expenses of medical supplies to the clinics and primary care units. These include oxygen therapy tanks, favipiravir, green chiretta capsules, blood pressure monitors, personal protective equipment, medical gloves, surgical masks, alcohol gel, and antigen rapid test kits.              It will also cover the expenses of providing the patients face marks, alcohol gel, fingertip pulse oximeters, digital thermometers, and food delivery.              The patients will consult with doctors via AMED Telehealth, a remote patient monitoring software developed by the National Science and Technology Development Agency.              Dr Atthaporn Limpanyalert, the NHSO Deputy Secretary-General, said that food delivery management could be flexible.              Clinics and primary care units can hire kitchens to cook meals for the patients while using their vehicles to deliver food. They can also hire app-based delivery people to deliver food to the patients’ doorstep. Another option is to provide patients with credits to order food by themselves. All these expenses can claim with the NHSO.                Dr Komen Tiwtong, Director of the Department of Primary Care and Family Doctor Clinics, Public Health Ministry’s Permanent Secretary Office, said that there were 178 primary care units registered under the Ministry and 204 private clinics partnering with the NHSO.              The Ministry set up Comprehensive COVID-19 Response Team consisting of health professionals, health academics, civil society representatives, health volunteers, and Bangkok district officials to support home and community isolation program. They will also coordinate between involved parties and provide medical supplies when in need.     "
79,79, Asymptomatic or Mild-symptom COVID-19 patients to isolate at home or community facilities   Wed 14 July 2021  ,"   Asymptomatic or Mild-symptom COVID-19 patients to isolate at home or community facilities             From July 12, COVID-19 patients with Asymptomatic or mild symptoms in Bangkok metropolitan region will be put into home isolation or community isolation. Those include 2,500 patients who dialed the 1330 hotline of the National Health Security Office (NHSO) and not yet get hospital beds.             NHSO secretary-general Dr Jadej Thammathach-aree said that home and community isolation was a recent public health measure to handle the shortage of hospitals beds and influx of patients at health facilities because of the rise of daily new cases.             In recent months, the NHSO hotline has been a contact point for coronavirus patients to book hospital beds. But many patients dialing the hotline have Asymptomatic or mild symptoms (classified as “green,”) which can be treated at home under the guidance of medical staff.              Putting all of them in hospitals will exhaust public health resources and medical staff while seizing the chances for moderate- and severe-symptom patients (classified as yellow and red, respectively) to access care and hospital facilities.             From now on, patients in the green category will be placed into home or community isolation. The latter is run in the facilities---including temple buildings and community halls---set up and managed by local communities.              Patients will be cared for by medical staff from 204 community or private clinics partnering with the NHSO. Each clinic can look after 200 patients.              Clinic staff will contact the patients within 48 hours after they dial the NHSO hotline, then deliver thermometers, oxygen saturation monitors, and green chiretta capsules for treating fever.             They will also closely monitor the patients by arranging video call and deliver three meals a day to patients’ houses or community isolation facilities.              If patients' health conditions are worsening, clinic staff will assist in transferring patients to hospitals. They will receive Favipiravir while waiting for the transfer.                “Home and community isolation will help COVID-19 patients access care and medicine faster. It’s better than leave him in uncertainty while waiting for hospital beds,” said Dr Jadej             In addition, the NHSO, Urban Institute for Disease Prevention and Control, and Mahidol University’s Faculty of Medical Technology are working together to launch a rapid antigen test service in several locations across Bangkok from July 14.             The service has a capacity of testing 10,000 people a day. Anyone who test positive and has mild symptoms will be sent into home or community isolation.    "
80,80, Free home care for Asymptomatic or mild-symptom COVID-19 patients   Thu 08 July 2021  ,"     Free home care for Asymptomatic or mild-symptom COVID-19 patients               COVID-19 patients in home isolation will get hospital care while receiving free health services, meals, and necessary medical equipment.             The cost of the care will be covered by National Health Security Office (NHSO), which has been working with public and private hospital operators to implement a reimbursement policy for home care and isolation.             NHSO Secretary-General Dr Jadej Thammathat-Aree said that home care for mild-symptom COVID-19 patients was piloted in some hospitals in Bangkok and metropolitan, including the Bangkok-based Rajavithi Hospital run by Public Health Ministry.             Home care includes online consulting with physicians, daily follow-up, delivery of meals, and necessary medical equipment such as thermometers and oxygen.              Patients may receive Andrographis paniculate capsules and favipiravir for treating fever. If they develop severe symptoms, hospital staff will send vehicles to pick up the patients from home.             Hospital staff will provide these services to patients for free and claim the fees from the NHSO. “This does not mean we leave the patients to handle with the coronavirus alone. This is pretty much like receiving care at hospitals, only that it happens at home,” said Dr Jadej.   “Doctors will assess the symptoms and health conditions of the patients, along with their home physical environment to decide whether home isolation suits them.”             The provision of home care for mild-symptom COVID-19 cases aims to reduce the crowd at hospitals, especially in Bangkok and its metropolitan where thousands of daily confirmed cases are reported.              With the rising cases, the bed capacities of many hospitals are brimful. Putting mild-symptom patients in home isolation will help saving hospital resources critical cases.              Dr Jadej said that the NHSO supports community isolation which local communities collectively manage isolation facilities for members with COVID-19. The facilities may set up in factories, temples, and community meeting halls.              Hospital staff then collaborate with local communities by dispatching mobile X-ray and laboratory vehicles to the facilities. Physicians arrange teleconferences with patients in the facilities to check their health conditions and symptoms.    NHSO covers the fees for these services:  - RT-PCR test, no more than 1,600 baht/test - Laboratory service, 600 baht/test. - Specimen sample collection, 100 baht/sample - Community isolation facility, 1,000 baht/day/case for 14 days - Medical equipment including thermometer and oxygen saturation for a     patient in home isolation, no more than 1,100 baht/case.  - Personal Protective Equipment for medical staff, 740 baht/case - Medicine for treating COVID-19, no more than 7,100 baht/case - Patient transfer, transportation, and vehicle cleaning, reimbursed based on driving distance but no more than 3,700 baht per trip - Chest X-ray service, 100 baht/time   "

The number of operators is not enough to handle the flood of calls from people needing help.   The volunteers will help the NHSO hotline staff screen people with positive test results and follow up on their health conditions while under home quarantine.    Patients with mild symptoms will be classified as green and placed in field hospitals or hospitels. Patients having problems in breathing or having chronic diseases will be classified as yellow, and red for those in severe conditions. Both groups will be sent to hospitals.   “No one should be left waiting at home and experience worsen health conditions or die in the worst case. To help them find hospital beds as soon as possible will increases the chance of their survival,” said Dr Jadej.   “We want to encourage everyone having a background in the healthcare field to volunteer with us.” Apply via NHSO phone number 02-5540506, or fill up a volunteer form at https://forms.gle/juH1kwa7dSX3XT629  "
82,82, New benefits package for VITT diagnosis and treatment   Mon 14 June 2021  ,"   New benefits package for VITT diagnosis and treatment    National Health Security Board approved laboratory testing and medication for treating Vaccine-induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT) in the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS)’s benefits package.    VITT is a prothrombotic syndrome observed in a small number of people who received adenoviral vector-based vaccines in Covid-19 vaccination programs. The exact incidence of VITT appears to be rare. Only one in 125,000 to one million vaccine recipients develop this condition.     VITT symptoms include severe headache, numbness, visual changes, difficulty breathing, one-sided paralysis, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, petechiae, leg pain, or swelling. The symptoms may show up in individuals within four to 30 days after vaccination.       Anutin Charnvirakul, Public Health Minister and the NHS board chairman, said that the introduction of VITT laboratory testing and treatment in the UCS’s benefits package aimed to bring confidence to the COVID-19 mass vaccination program.     “Thai government will take care of people experiencing adverse effects after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine,” said Anutin.    The vaccine recipients who find implications caused by VITT can request free laboratory testing at their registered hospitals. They will receive free treatment, too, if they are diagnosed with VITT.      NHSO Secretary-General Dr Jadej Thammathach-Aree said that NHSO would cover the cost of four items relating to VITT diagnosis and treatment;   Complete blood count (CBC), maximum of 50 baht per test Heparin-PF4 antibody (lgG) ELISA assay, maximum of 1,550 baht per test Heparin-induced platelet activation test (HIPA), maximum of 1,550 baht per test Human normal immunoglobulin, intravenous (IVIG) for treating VITT.     The NHSO prepares around 9.28 million baht to cover the cost of IVIG, said Dr Jadej.

83,83, A guideline issued for a COVID-19 vaccine side effects fund   Thu 20 May 2021  ,"   A guideline issued for a COVID-19 vaccine side effects fund   National Health Security Office (NHSO) issues a guideline for compensating COVID-19 vaccine recipients who experience adverse effects.    A guideline sets criteria and steps for the compensation claims. Only the Thai recipients of the COVID-19 vaccine provided by the government are eligible to submit the claims. They must receive the vaccine from 5 April onward.    They or their families can proceed with the claims at hospitals providing vaccines to them, provincial health offices, or NHSO regional offices. The submission can take place within two years after the adverse effects occur.   Each claim submission will be scrutinized by the subcommittee set in each NHSO regional area. The amount of compensation depends on the damages caused by the vaccination side effects and the financial condition of the vaccine recipients.    A maximum of 400,000 baht in compensation will be paid to a recipient or his/her family if he/she is dead or permanently disabled. A recipient who lost an organ will receive a maximum of 240,000 baht. A maximum of 100,000 baht will be paid for any injury or illness sustained.      The payment will proceed within five days after the subcommittee approves the claims.  Dr Jadej Thammatach-aree, the NHSO’s Secretary-General, said that the NHSO set up a 100-million-baht fund for paying the compensation.    In the mid of May, officers at the NHSO region 1 office in Chiang Mai and region 10 office in Ubon Ratchathani reported receiving 218 and 49 claim submissions, respectively, from health workers.     For region 1, the adverse effects occurred in 0.24% of health workers receiving 91,551 doses of COVID-19 vaccine in total. Only 0.05% of them required hospital admission.    “Half of the health workers experiencing side effects had minor symptoms, such as temporary fever and muscle pain. The most-reported severe symptoms are high fever and muscle cramps,” said Dr Jadej.   “It proves that vaccination is safe. However, we still need to provide compensation to those experience adverse effects to bring confidence to the government’s vaccination program, while assuring the health protection of Thais.”   The Thai government has provided 1.46 million doses to its people, with no report of deadly side effects. The Chinese-made Sinovac and British-Swedish AstraZeneca are the primary vaccines distributed by the Thai government.    Dr Jadej urges everyone to reach out to health facilities or government officials to request vaccination.   “Only successful vaccination will return our normal life,” he said.         "
84,84, COVID-19 vaccine recipients experiencing adverse events will be compensated   Wed 05 May 2021  ,"   COVID-19 vaccine recipients experiencing adverse events will be compensated   COVID-19 vaccine recipients can request compensation from the Thai government, via National Health Security Office (NHSO), if they experience post-vaccination adverse events.    The compensation will be offered to the vaccine recipients based on the guideline drafted by NHSO in collaboration with Public Health Ministry. The guideline, to be released this week, will include procedures and methods for the vaccine recipients to file the compensation request. Only Thais and health workers will be eligible for the compensation.     ""Though the COVID-19 vaccine passed the clinical trial, side effects can happen depending on recipients' health conditions,"" said NHSO Secretary-General Dr Jadej Thammathat-Aree.   ""We will provide preliminary compensation to mitigate the vaccination's side effects for the recipients, without any procedures to find who is right and wrong.

85,85, ​No hospital charges for COVID-19 patients   Mon 03 May 2021  ,"   No hospital charges for COVID-19 patients   National Health Security Office (NHSO) urges hospital operators not to charge COVID-19 patients for any health services. Thai government will reimburse the hospitals for any expense incurred.   With the rising COVID-19 cases in Thailand, hospital beds and facilities are in high demand, especially in Bangkok, where the new coronavirus cluster was detected early April.    NHSO Secretary-General Dr Jadej Thammathat-Aree said that hospitals providing treatment to COVID-19 patients will be reimbursed.   The sources of the reimbursement fund come from the Thai government's three healthcare schemes; Universal Coverage Scheme (run by the NHSO), Social Security Scheme (run by Social Security Office), and Civil Servant Medical Benefits (run by the Comptroller General's Department).     Currently, the NHSO pays the cost of COVID-19 testing for every Thai regardless of their registered healthcare schemes. If a person is tested positive, an operator of a healthcare scheme that person registered with will reimburse the hospitals for the cost of providing treatment.      ""Thai government makes a strong commitment to supporting every COVID-19 patient and hospital nationwide,"" said Dr Jadej, responding to the reports on social media that find hospital operators charged the patients.   Both public and private hospital operators can process the claims with healthcare scheme operators if the schemes' beneficiaries admit to their hospitals. If patients have private insurance, the health service fees shall be paid by the insurance companies first. The schemes' operators will reimburse the additional cost.   Any hospital operator will receive approximately 800,000 baht for providing treatment to a severe COVID-19 patient. Around 400,000 baht will be paid for treating an uncritical patient. Thai government reimburses the hospital operators for the following items.   1. Outpatient service -Lab test and specimen collection. -COVID-19 treatment (a maximum of 7,200 baht/case)  -Patient transfer service (depends on travel distance) -Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and cleaner (a maximum of 3,700 baht/case)    2. Inpatient service -Lab test and specimen collection. -COVID-19 treatment (a maximum of 7,200 baht/case)  -Hospital room charge (2,500 baht/day/case) -Hospitel, cohort ward, or camp isolation (1,500 baht/day/case) -Patient transfer service (depends on travel distance) -Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and cleaner (a maximum of 3,700 baht/case) -Protective suit (740 baht/unit)  -Medical and protective equipment used for patients with few symptoms (11,100 baht/day/case)  -Medical and protective equipment used for patients in severe conditions (22,200 baht/day/case)    3. Laboratory test  -Nasopharyngeal/throat swab specimen test RT-PCR (1,600 baht/test, 600 baht for staff compensation, and 100 baht for specimen collection.)  - Combination of RT-PCR such as; saliva sample test (320 baht/test, 100 baht for staff fees, and 100 baht for specimen collection), nasopharyngeal/throat swab specimen test (400 baht/test, 75 baht for staff fees, and 100 baht for specimen collection), and repeat RT-PCR for persons having positive test results (1,600 baht/test, 200 baht for staff fees and specimen collection) -Antigen test (a maximum of 1,200 baht/test) -Antibody test (a maximum of 350 baht/test)    "

NHSO commits to engage all stakeholders in its decision-making process as described in article 18 of the National Health Security Act, which became effective in 2002,"" he said.   NHSO has annually run public hearings to get feedback and hear suggestions from UCS stakeholders, including health providers, patient groups, local administrative organizations, and vulnerable populations.     This year, series of public hearings are run from early March to June, mainly via Facebook live and Zoom meetings due to the pandemic. The hearings were held in four out of 13 NHSO's regional areas such as region 13 (Bangkok), region 10 (Ubon Ratchathani), region 9 (Nakhon Ratchasima), and region 8 (Udon Thani).    NHSO will organize virtual public hearings in the rest of the regional areas by the end of May. All opinions will be gathered, analyzed, and put in policy recommendations to be discussed during the national-level public hearing on 25 June.   There are seven main issues to be discussed: the scope of public health services provided under UCS, the standard of health services, UCS fund management, NHSO's operation, Community Health Fund management, stakeholders participation, health literacy, and healthcare rights protection.    ""Since the introduction of UCS 18 years ago, we put a consistent effort on improving the scheme by increasing benefits package coverage, improving healthcare access, and healthcare rights protection for the beneficiaries,"" said Dr Jedsada.    ""We are well aware that public hearing gives the UCS ownership to all stakeholders, which make it a crucial element that brings sustainability to the UCS.""      "
87,87, Push forward a healthcare program for non-Thai prisoners   Mon 03 May 2021  ,"   Push forward a healthcare program for non-Thai prisoners   National Health Security Office (NHSO) pushes forward a healthcare program for non-Thai prisoners in collaboration with the Ministry of Justice and Public Health Ministry.    On April 5, the NHSO board chaired by Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul had the resolution to push forward a healthcare program for non-Thai prisoners proposed by the Ministry of Justice.   NHSO Secretary-General Dr Jadej Thammathat-Aree revealed that 5.65% of inmates in Thailand, or around 19,000, are non-Thai. Among them are undocumented people (4,000) and foreigners (15,000) who are not covered by any healthcare schemes and health insurance.   Without healthcare coverage, public hospitals providing humanitarian healthcare services in prisons must carry a financial burden. According to Public Health Ministry, which runs public hospitals, hospital operators must pay between 13 and 14 million baht annually to cover the healthcare cost for non-Thai prisoners.   Meanwhile, Thai inmates are covered by the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS), which provides healthcare access to 47 million Thais regardless of their social and financial status.   To solve this challenge, the Ministry of Justice, which operates prisons across Thailand, requested the Thai cabinet's approval to set a healthcare fund for non-Thai inmates. After receiving the request, the Secretariat of the Cabinet (SoC) turned to the NHSO for a recommendation.   ""NHSO board supports the Ministry of Justice's request. We agree that non-Thai prisoners shall access healthcare with no differences from others,"" said Dr Jadej, adding that the NHSO board will pass its recommendation to the SoC.   If it is approved, the fund will cover essential healthcare services for around 16,000 inmates at an early stage of a program. About 13.71 million baht will be required annually.   The source of the fund will come from Public Health Ministry and the central government. NHSO, of which staff has high experience managing the healthcare program for vulnerable populations, will take responsibility in providing and managing the fund after the program is firmly established.

88,88, NHSO's platforms for COVID-19 beds and screening test inquiries   Tue 27 April 2021  ,"   NHSO's platforms for COVID-19 beds and screening test inquiries   National Health Security Office (NHSO) uses its communication platforms to help COVID-19 patients find beds and screening test stations.     NHSO secretary-general Dr Jadej Thammathat-Aree said recently that COVID-19 patients could call the NHSO's 1330 hotline to require beds in healthcare facilities.    The hotline operators will coordinate with hospitals and health authorities to answer the needs of the patients. They can also contact hospitals to send ambulances to pick up Covid-19 patients.   In response to the surging number of Covid-19 cases, especially in Bangkok, NHSO has worked with Public Health Ministry, Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, and private hospitals to set up field hospitals to handle rising demands for beds.     Along with the NHSO's hotline, the Department of Medical Services (DMS), Ministry of Public Health and National Institute  for Emergency Medical (NIEM) also run 1668 and 1669 hotlines to support both patients and general people seeking further information on COVID-19 treatment facilities.   For those who require COVID-19 testing, they can check on the NHSO website (https://www.nhso.go.th/page/covid19) to find out the available screening test stations. They only need to fill up identification numbers and the date of birth on the website to get information access.    ""Those who are in the high-risk group, including showing symptoms, exposing to the confirmed cases, visiting pandemic-affected areas, or suspecting themselves to contract COVID-19, we encourage them to get screening tests at state and private hospitals,"" said Dr Jadej.   ""The services fees will be covered by NHSO.""

89,89, 3.75-billion-baht fund approved for fighting COVID-19    Mon 26 April 2021  ,"   3.75-billion-baht fund approved for fighting COVID-19    Thai cabinet approved a 3.75-billion-baht fund for National Health Security Office (NHSO) to support health units in COVID-19 emergency response.    The fund is a part of the government's one-trillion-baht loan decree to fight against the pandemic and mitigate its social and economic impact.    It will cover the cost for hospitals providing COVID-19 relevant services without interrupting other essential health services under Universal Health Coverage System.     NHSO secretary-general Dr Jadej Thammathat-Aree said that part of the recent approval fund would answer the increasing need for COVID-19 screening tests, following the discovery of highly contagious UK strain in local cases.    Initially, the screening test is provided to persons identified as ""Patient Under Investigation"" under the Department of Disease Control (DDC) 's guideline. They must show COVID-19 symptoms and have a history of visiting the pandemic-affected areas or work in quarantine facilities.    However, the recent local cases with UK variant tend to show no or very few symptoms, pushing the DDC to include ""doctor's diagnosis"" as a new condition to approve coronavirus screening tests.   As a result, more people require the tests recently despite showing no symptoms.  The government fund obtained by the NHSO will cover;   1.Nasopharyngeal/throat swab specimen test RT-PCR (NHSO will cover 1,600 baht  per test, 600 baht for staff compensation, and 100 for specimen collection.)    2.Combination of RT-PCR, such as;   - Pooled saliva samples (320 baht per test, 100 baht for staff fees, and 100 baht for specimen collection)    - Pooled nasopharyngeal and throat swab samples (400 baht per test, 75 baht for staff fees, and 100 baht for specimen collection)   - Repeat of RT-PCR for persons having positive test results (1,600 baht per test, 200 baht for staff fees and specimen collection)   3.Antigen test (No exceed than 1,200 baht per test)   4.Antibody test (No exceed than 350 baht per test)   It will also cover the cost for running negative pressure rooms (2,500 baht/case/day,) field hospitals and hospitels (1,500 baht/case/day.)   Though the Thai government encourages people to get COVID-19 testing and treatment at state hospitals, NHSO will cover the cost of services for patients getting service in private hospitals.    ""COVID-19 pandemic is an emergency situation that will bring the financial burden to patients if any healthcare schemes do not cover them.   We want everyone in Thailand to feel confident that if they follow doctors and hospital staff's guidance, they will not need to pay any fees,"" said Dr Jadej.     NHSO will reimburse the fees to the hospital operators directly.    In supporting hospital operators, NHSO has recently adjusted its claim process by allowing hospital operators to claim the cost for providing COVID-19 relevant services every two weeks.  In a normal situation, the claims process takes around one month to transfer public health funds to hospital operators.    ""This will maintain financial liquidity for hospital operators who must provide emergency services every day,"" said Dr Jadej.     "
90,90, Thai government ensures COVID-19 essential health services   Mon 19 April 2021  ,"   Thai government ensures COVID-19 essential health services   People at high risk of COVID-19 can request free COVID-19 testing at public and private hospitals across Thailand, and reserve hospital beds if they are tested positive, announced National Health Security Office (NHSO) and Public Health Ministry.     The announcement came during the surge of the coronavirus cases, which spread from an entertainment venue cluster in Bangkok early this month. As of April 16, more than 39,000 confirmed cases are reported in Thailand.       Dr Kritiya Sriprasert, the NHSO advisor, said during the Friday virtual seminar that the Thai government covered health service fees for several items, including laboratory tests, specimen sample collections, medicines, and personal protective equipment.    Free hospital room, meals, and transports for suspected and confirmed cases are also included in the government's health benefits package.   The seminar was held to explain the steps for requesting testing and reserve hospital beds. Beneficiaries of all healthcare schemes run by Thai government---Universal Coverage Scheme, Social Security Scheme, and Civil Servant Medical Benefits Scheme---can request COVID-19 services at any hospitals if they are at high risk of COVID-19.    A person at high risk includes one having close contact with an infected case---defined as having a conversation within one meter of an infected person for at least five minutes, or being within one meter of an infected person for a total of 15 minutes or more.   In a normal situation, beneficiaries of the government's healthcare schemes are encouraged to visit public hospitals. But as the coronavirus pandemic is an emergency situation, said Dr Kritiya, they can request health services at private hospitals if necessary.    NHSO, along with the other healthcare scheme's operators, will reimburse the service fees with private hospitals under the Universal Coverage for Emergency Patients (UCEP) program, aiming to increase people's access to emergency care and their chances of survival.    If the patients have private health insurance, they shall claim the service cost from the insurance providers first. Any extended cost outside the personal insurance coverage will be reimbursed by Thai government.     Dr Pathomporn Siraprapasiri from Public Health Permanent Secretary Office said during the seminar that the staff of hospitals entered by patients would find beds for patients based on their symptoms.    While waiting for lab test results, patients will be asked to stay under home quarantine. If their lab tests show negative results, they will be required to stay home and isolate themselves from others because the coronavirus symptoms may not show during their first lab tests.    If patients are tested positive, the hospital staff will seek available beds in their facilities or hospital networks.   Beds are available in three facility options; inpatient beds for those showing symptoms of pneumonia, field hospitals and hospitels (hotels that are adjusted for healthcare purposes) for those aged under 50, having good health and showing few symptoms.    People who use lab test services without going through hospitals, and if the lab facilities are not in the hospital networks, they will need to contact healthcare agencies to request hospital beds.   The contact points include NHSO's 1330 hotline, 1669 emergency hotline, and @Sabaideebot, a Line account created by Public Health Ministry.    Dr Pathomporn urges patients not to contact more than one of these channels, as they are all linked to one database.    It is reported that some people reserve beds with several channels, filling up data space and making information overlap. It consumes time and cost to clean up the data space.     "
91,91, NHSO covers COVID-19 testing fees for Thai people   Fri 16 April 2021  ,"  NHSO covers COVID-19 testing fees for Thai people   Every Thai at risk of contracting COVID-19 can get free test and treatment at any public and private hospitals. National Health Security Office (NHSO), the governmental organization overseeing Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS), will cover the cost of coronavirus health services for Thai people regardless of their registered healthcare schemes.   People at risk of contracting COVID-19 are identified as showing one of these symptoms; fever with body temperature over 37.5 degrees celsius, cough, running nose, sore throat, smell or taste loss, or shortness of breath.     They must also have a history of linking to one of these risk factors;   -Visit COVID-19 affected areas 14 days before showing the symptoms above. High-risk areas are often crowded with people, including fresh markets, department stores, hospitals, entertainment venues, and public transport hubs.   -Reside or visit places/countries with the report of COVID-19 cases 14 days before showing the symptoms above.      -Work in quarantine facilities      NHSO secretary-general Dr Jadej Thammatach-aree raised concern for the new wave of COVID-19, which starts from an entertainment venue cluster discovered in Bangkok this week.    Many cases are reported to have UK strain that show no or few symptoms, and can spread faster than the kind previously found in Thailand.   “If you have a history of visiting COVID-19 affected areas or contacting people visiting those areas, though you have no symptoms, you can request free test from both public and private hospitals. Don’t worry about the service fees,” said Dr Jadej.   Public Health Ministry, which runs public hospitals, and the Private Hospital Association, assure that health workers will provide COVID-19 testing to anyone at risk of contracting the virus. They will receive free treatment if they test positive. NHSO will reimburse the services fees with the hospital operators.   For migrant workers, the Department of Disease Control will cover the cost of health service fees.    ""I can assure that all health workers will provide the best services. If you have one of the symptoms, with a history of visiting COVID-19 affected exposure to the coronavirus, don't hesitate to visit doctors. It's better to reach out to hospitals before you are severely sick,"" said Dr Jadej.   If you have any inquiries, contact NHSO's 1330 Hotline or DDC's 1422 Hotline.     "
92,92, Cut back on sodium intake to live well and longer with or without kidney disease   Mon 05 April 2021  ,"  Cut back on sodium intake to live well and longer with or without kidney disease   As data by the Nephrology Society of Thailand (NST) shows Thai people on average consume sodium twice the level they should, it is now more necessary than ever to carry out a public campaign aimed at curbing consumers’ daily sodium intake and risk of developing diseases associated with salty food eating habits, especially kidney failure. “Habit and attitude change [to eat less salty food] will be an important mechanism for preventing diseases [associated with high sodium consumption],” said Dr Sakchai Kanjanawatana, secretary-general of the National Health Security Office (NHSO).     “We will therefore have to campaign for consumers to cut back on their sodium intake by at least half,” he said, marking World Kidney Day 2021 on March 11.   The World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned member countries to reduce their sodium consumption rates by 30%, said Assoc Prof Dr Surasak Kantachuvesiri, president of the NST.   Excessive salt intake can lead to high blood pressure (hypertension), stroke, ischemic heart disease and kidney disease, which means consuming less salt will help save tens of billions of baht in state healthcare budget per year, he said.   In Thailand there are about 22 million people with health problems associated with salty food eating, as the average rate of salt and sodium consumption is 3,600 milligram per day, or twice the proper sodium intake a person should get, he said.   According to a guideline by WHO, the highest overall sodium intake per day per person shouldn’t exceed 2,000mg.   “A vast majority of Thai people tend to like eating salty food, especially the people in the South where the average sodium consumption rate is a lot higher than those of other regions,” he said.   About 8 million people have kidney disease, 13 million people have high blood pressure, 25 million others have heart disease and paralysis, and the other 5 million have diabetes, he said.   Each year about 40,000 people die of heart disease, while the average age of patients diagnosed with kidney disease is decreasing, he said, adding that these health problems are linked with the high consumption rate of salty food, particularly instant food and snacks.   Kidney disease becomes a high-cost health problem when reaching a stage where the patient requires kidney dialysis or a kidney transplant, he said.   Kidney dialysis costs at least 200,000 baht per person per year, while those undergoing a kidney transplant will need immunosuppressants, drugs or medicines that lower the body's ability to reject a transplanted organ, for the rest of their lives, he said.   These factors cost Thailand’s three healthcare schemes altogether more than 20 billion baht in additional expenses, he said.   The three schemes are the Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme (CSMBS) for civil servants and their families, Social Security Scheme (SSS) for private employees, and the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS).   These health problems actually can be prevented by such as adjusting eating and drinking habits, he said.   Drinking plenty of clean water, cutting back on eating salty food, stop drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes, and using herbal medicines properly will help prevent and delay kidney degeneration, he said.   Reducing salt consumption by 10%, deaths linked with this bad eating habit will be reduced by up to 30%, he said, adding that this disease prevention measure will lead to a large decrease in healthcare costs in the next decade.   As for food producers, he said, they will possibly be required to display a more legible label on their products to inform consumers about nutrition facts, including information about calories and the sodium contain in the products.   A written health warning message such as “Eating too much salty food is bad for your heath” will possibly be required to be included into food labels, as part of a public campaign to raise public awareness over the need to reduce use of condiments, he said.   State agencies concerned should also come up with financial measures to make healthy food cheaper than the types of food that actually harm the health of people, he said. These government organisations are also encouraged to conduct campaigns for food makers to lower the salt content of their products and educate consumers more about harmful health effects of the salty food eating habit, he said.   This year’s Thai theme of World Kidney Day, is Change Your Attitude and Habits to Live Longer with Kidney Failure , said Dr Sakchai.     The global theme is “Kidney Health for Everyone Everywhere: Living Well with Kidney Disease”.   Both the Social Security Office (SSO) and the NHSO assured they have a highly effective system to take good care of kidney patients registered under their healthcare schemes.  About 20,000 kidney patients needing kidney dialysis are covered by the SSS, which costs about 3 billion baht per year, said Nonglak Koworakun, acting director of Medical Service System Management Bureau of the SSO.     “So, patients with end-stage renal disease need not to worry about this healthcare service. However, although how strongly we are committed to providing kidney dialysis to these patients as long as they need it, we don’t actually want to see more kidney patients [develop end-stage kidney failure],” she said.   Disease prevention always is the best course of action when dealing with kidney disease that requires high-cost treatment, said Kanitsak Chantharaphiphat, director of the NHSO's secondary and tertiary service system support office.

The cooperation is a part of the Partnership Project for Global Health and Universal Health Coverage Phase 2 (GLO+UHC Phase 2), aiming to strengthen health financing, health workforce, and global health of Thailand, Japan, and other countries.   In this partnership, JICA, NHSO, and Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) will work together to achieve the three outputs as follows:  1. Share experience on UHC between Thailand and Japan to contribute to improve the UHC in both countries;  2.Organize capacity development for UHC implementation and global health in other countries;  3.Share and promote practical practices and lessons learned in UHC implementation and global health, mainly from Japan and Thailand, at national, regional, and international levels.    From today to 2023, the partnership will deliver a series of capacity-building workshops, lectures, policy recommendations, and study visits to Japan to learn about Japan’s successful UHC system. In addition, Thailand and Japan will share lessons learned and good practices of UHC implementation with other countries, for instance, Asian and African countries which are striving for UHC, at international conferences such as the Prince Mahidol Award Conference (PMAC). This is also a good opportunity to form a network for further international collaboration.   The presence of Thailand and Japan in the global health arena was enhanced as both countries collaborated at a high-level meeting on UHC, drafting a political declaration, and south-south technical collaboration in essential areas of UHC.   The Partnership Project for Global Health and Universal Health Coverage was launched four years ago and achieved fruitful outcomes. Through a wide range of activities, Thai organizations and health officials have improved capacity on many aspects of UHC implementation, for example, healthcare finance, health information system, health workforce, and UHC for children and mothers.   Japan achieved UHC by expanding the public insurance to farmers in 1961, and Thailand achieved UHC in 2002 by launching the Universal Coverage Scheme. Both countries have gained remarkable health outcomes and faced similar challenges, including the increase of healthcare costs and rapid aging.    "

It sets nine goals to be achieved in the coming years, which are;    1. Unite healthcare reimbursement system, starting from the healthcare claims for health promotion and disease prevention services, primary care, community/home care, and inpatient care. Currently, there are three healthcare schemes, such as Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS), Social Security Scheme, and Civil Servant Medical Benefits Scheme, run separately by various government agencies.   2. Every government's healthcare scheme shares the same management and reimbursement system as well as benefits package, which will increase Thailand's capacity to handle the future health crises and emerging diseases. The management will include sharing beneficiary registration system, data exchange between healthcare schemes' operators, and collaborative support for health facilities to improve quality and standard of health services.   3. Prioritize health promotion and disease prevention programs. The government shall set the program's budget in separation from the medical treatment budget. The health promotion and disease prevention programs are currently funded by the government's health budget, prioritizing medical treatment rather than health promotion and disease prevention activities despite their considerable benefits on national health security.     4. Expand long-term care program to beneficiaries of all healthcare schemes while increasing its funds to encounter Thailand's aging society. The program is currently available only for UCS beneficiaries.    5. Health insurance must be compulsory for all migrant workers in Thailand. They shall have different options of health insurance.    6. Set the targets and indicators to achieve value-based healthcare. Pilot it in selected health facilities or health region areas.    7. Achieve Universal Coverage for Emergency Patients (UCEP) with a single-payer system, and define the reimbursement rates, terms, and criteria acceptable for state and private hospitals.    8. Establish a health database that includes data people and health services in all healthcare schemes. The data, which shall be shared with relevant parties based on mutual benefits, shall cover vulnerable populations, including elderly and dependent patients.    9. Mining data from the reimbursement system and use it to design effective health systems for all stakeholders.   Dr Jadej Thammatacharee, NHSO deputy secretary-general, said that the NHSO set a subcommittee for moving forward and harmonizing the government's health insurance system to push and monitor the implementation of the reform roadmap. From January 2021 to December 2022, goals number one, five, six, and eight mentioned above will be prioritized.   Dr Akejit Changloa, subcommittee chairman, emphasizes the health promotion and disease prevention programs to reduce diseases' burden.    ""To implement the program effectively, we need to increase people's health literacy. We also need to empower vulnerable populations, including people with disabilities and dependent people, to help them move forward with the society,"" he said.    "

Each clinic has at least one physiotherapist, passing health authorities' standard checks and obtaining a license under Thai health regulation.      They will receive patients with stroke, traumatic brain, and spinal cord injury transferred from state hospitals, which will share patients' health condition data with the clinics to achieve therapeutic outcomes.   The NHSO will reimburse the service fees to the clinics, supported by the Thai government's 10-million-baht budget set for health facilities to adapt to social distancing.   "
97,97, Increase CAPD access for patients with kidney disease   Wed 03 March 2021  ,"   Increase CAPD access for patients with kidney disease    Since 2008, peritoneal dialysis has been provided to patients with kidney disease under Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS).    To include the treatment in UCS benefits package was not an easy task at the beginning. It was challenged by many people who doubted the effectiveness of peritoneal dialysis and its high cost, which would place financial pressure on the Thai government.      Kanitsak Chantrapipat, Director Bureau of Secondary and Tertiary Care Management,  National Health Security Office (NHSO) recently highlighted the keys to resolve those challenges --- building up cooperation across multi sectors, increasing the capacity of human resources and health facilities, and implementing the right financial model.    NHSO discussed Thailand's experience in setting a strategy to increase patients' access to renal replacement therapy (RRT) during an international webinar on 10 February.    Held by NHSO, the event was joined by more than 60 experts from international countries, including the United States, Singapore, South Korea, and Indonesia, who came to learn the recipes of Thailand's success.     Policy push    Renal replacement therapies such as peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis have been available in Thailand since 30 years ago. But access to the therapies was limited in the past because of the treatments' high cost and insufficient supplies in health facilities. Only a few patients could access the treatment, leaving many low-income patients with financial constraints to have a little survival chance.   A few years after the introduction of UCS in 2002, NHSO began working with patient groups to include renal replacement therapy (RRT) in UCS benefits package. The therapies were already provided to beneficiaries of Social Security Scheme and Civil Servant Medical Benefits Scheme at the time, raising critics toward inequitable access to health services.    Responded to NHSO and patients group, the Thai cabinet approved the request to add renal replacement therapy (RRT) in UCS benefits package and started providing them in 2008. The priority was given to Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD), a cost-effective treatment option that requires fewer human resources and fits the Thai government's financial circumstance.   It also suits the contexts of Thai patients, many of whom reside in rural areas and have difficulties traveling to hospitals to get hemodialysis.    Patients could perform CAPD at their homes. They are charged “zero” as NHSO covers up the dialysis fluid and logistic cost to deliver it to patients’ houses. If patients with end-stage renal disease have contraindications to CAPD treatment, they can request hemodialysis without charging any fees.   Change perception   However, both physicians and patients prefer hemodialysis at the time. They falsely perceived that CAPD was not an effective treatment. Changing their perception was very critical. To do that, NHSO worked with health networks to provide CAPD training to physicians and nurses.    In 2007, nurses from hospitals piloting CAPD care attended a 5-day intensive course at Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen University, to tune their attitude and ideas about CAPD. Some nurses visited Singapore General Hospital and Tan Tock Seng Hospital a year later to gain experience on the CAPD system.   Thailand Nursing Council also launched four-month CAPD training courses for nurses across Thailand.  Similar, nephrologists from piloted hospitals participated a 2-day intensive meeting to understand the government's CAPD policy. Some of them visited Hong Kong to learn how a similar policy was established and successfully implemented.   Patient with kidney diseases formed up a group called Kidney Friend-Club Network to assist patients and their families performing CAPD in local communities and health care units.      CAPD access increases   Three and a half years after the introduction of peritoneal dialysis in UCS, more than 340 nurses joined CAPD training while 345 physicians were registered for the Tenchkoff catheter insertion workshop.   The number of patients receiving peritoneal dialysis increased from 212 to 8,033 between January 2008 and June 2011. Peritoneal dialysis units increased from 23 to 111 units at the same period of time.    Moreover, the ratio of patients receiving CAPD increased to 54% of all patients receiving renal replacement treatments, while hemodialysis accounted for 46%.    In 2020, more than 32,330 patients received CAPD under the government's 9.7-billion-baht supporting funds.     Despite several obstacles, said Kanitsak, the provision of peritoneal dialysis in UCS has been gradually improving.    The number of peritoneal dialysis centers, nurses, and patients' access to care is promising. He also gave credit to all partners that make this happen---Public Health Ministry, NHSO, patients groups, health providers, doctors, and nurses who put their effort into improving the conditions for patients with kidney disease.

98,98, NHSO fosters inclusive public engagement in Thai health system   Wed 24 Febuary 2021  ,"   NHSO fosters inclusive public engagement in Thai health system   Recent research finds the National Health Security Office (NHSO)’s participatory procedure is inclusive and successful in empowering vulnerable groups in Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS).   The research, conducted by King Prajadhipok's Institute, examines the development of public hearing held under the National Health Security Act 2002, by looking at a participatory procedure run in NHSO’s cluster one that covers eight of Thailand’s northern provinces — Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Lamphun, Lampang, Mae Hong Song, Nan, Phayao, and Phare.   The area is home to several ethnic groups and multi-cultural populations. Local communities have experienced the challenges from socio-economic changes, resulting in rapid urbanization and livelihood changes that leave many people in vulnerabilities.   To hear the voices of these people, the NHSO region one (Chiang Mai) develops an effective participatory procedure by organizing provincial-level public hearings and focus-group meetings, using both traditional and online platforms.    Opinions from all platforms are gathered and analyzed to make recommendations to NHSO’s headquarter office. After the hearing, NHSO staff will update a stage of policy with participants to show how their ideas are adopted at a policy level.   Moreover, NHSO practice requires all officers within its cluster office to participate in the public hearing process from the start to the end. They could be coordinators, data collectors, or presenters of recommendations.   The research finds that the hearing process emphasizes vulnerable people's voices, especially ethnic groups, the elderly, and disable people.    Inclusive public hearings are done by tapping the resources from the networks of civil society, grassroots organizations, and local communities. On the other hand, it empowers the stakeholders and creates a sense of ownership toward UCS.     For example, the past public hearing was held at Chiang Rai’s Mae Suai Hospital, a hub for ethnic maternal and child care. Local civil society groups, who work closely with the NHSO branch office staff, help organize and lead public hearings for people living in mountainous areas.   The research concludes that the participatory procedure run by NHSO region one (Chiang Mai) is successful in terms of geographic comprehensiveness and inclusion of stakeholders from all sectors.   It also allows NHSO to identify specific challenges in the area, while decentralizing health policy decisions to multi-stakeholders and vulnerable groups.   “A significant push towards a real implementation of the national health security system was achieved by opening spaces for different sectors to voice their opinions in an atmosphere of learning, exchange of knowledge, and cooperation,” suggested by the research.   “This process allows knowledge building and information exchange between experts and relevant sectors, leading to the prototype national health security system and a fiscal blueprint of public health for national policy.”    "
99,99, UCS ensures healthcare access for unemployed persons during the COVID-19 crisis   Thu 11 Febuary 2021  ,"   UCS ensures healthcare access for unemployed persons during the COVID-19 crisis   COVID-19 pandemic and containment measures have forced many people to lose jobs in Thailand, meaning the changes in their healthcare benefits.   Under Thai law, every worker hired by legal companies gain healthcare access through Social Security Scheme (SSS), while the government officials are registered under Civil Servant Medical Benefits Scheme.   Unemployed persons, independent workers, self-employed and person who are not cover by other public health scheme accounting for 47 million Thais, are covered by Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS).   As many workers lose jobs, their healthcare benefits will be shifted from SSS to UCS. To ensure their healthcare access, National Health Security Office (NHSO), the government agency that oversees UCS, has obtained 366 million baht from the central government to cover healthcare for unemployed persons.     “We’ve prepared the budget to look after their health. They can still access healthcare services despite their unemployment status,” said NHSO Secretary-General Dr Sakchai Kanjanawatana.   It’s estimated that at least 137,000 unemployed persons will become UCS beneficiaries this year.   Between January and September last year, the number of UCS beneficiaries increased approximately 14,700 persons per month, while the number of SSS members declined at the same period of time.

100,100, New medication reduces hepatitis C testing steps   Thu 11 Febuary 2021  ,"   New medication reduces hepatitis C testing steps   Since early this year, Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) beneficiaries can access sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, a fixed-dose combination medication for hepatitis C treatment in adults.   The drug, which is more than 90% effective for all hepatitis C genotypes, was added into UCS’s benefits package following an approval by the National Health Security Board (NHSB) in December.   It is also added to the National List of Essential Medicines, a list of medications used in the hospitals and public health services in Thailand.   The availability of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in UCS benefits package will allow patients with hepatitis C to have better treatment access, said health experts during a virtual seminar on “hepatitis C screening test and treatment in UCS” on 20 January.     Testing every risk group    “Around 90% of liver cancer cases are caused by hepatitis C. Infected persons will develop liver cancer within 10 years after contracting the virus. There is no symptom showing during an early stage of infection, making patients unaware of the infection until it is too late,” said Dr Preecha Premsiri, deputy director-general of the Department of Disease Control (DDC), Ministry 0f Public Health.   “While COVID-19 pandemic is raging our world, the prevalence of hepatitis C gains a little attention from the society.”   DDC estimates that around 400,000 people in Thailand are infected by hepatitis C. Approximately 80,000 of them may likely die, based on the scenario that 20% of them develop liver cancer.   Therefore, it’s essential to test every risk population group such as inmates, people living with HIV, and injecting drug users as soon as they contract the virus.    “We set an ambitious target to test every risk group in every province across Thailand,” said Dr Preecha.   “We have collaborated with local administrative organizations to launch hepatitis C test at a community level. Once we find infected persons, we will deliver care and treatment to them immediately.”   Reduce testing steps   In the early years of UCS, patients living with hepatitis C received partial treatment because of high-cost medication.       Nimit Tian-udom, NHSB represents civil society, recalled that the medication cost around 30,000-baht per dose. Each patient was required to take medication for three months, which cost two million baht per case.    The cost of treatment has reduced in recent years as the National Health Security Office or NHSO achieved in negotiating the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir medication price down to 280 baht per dose.   Dr Pisit Tangkijvanich, President of Thai Association for the Study of the Liver, said that the provision of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir would help shorten the hepatitis C screening procedure.   Patients do not need to go through Fibro Scan, a specialized ultrasound machine for measuring fibrosis and steatosis in the liver, which liver specialists can only perform.   Patients can get HCV antibody tests, which look for antibodies to the hepatitis C virus in the blood, and APRI Score or FIB-4 Score, the ways to measure fibrosis of the liver for people infected by hepatitis C.   “Physicians can conduct this test, so patients don’t need to wait in a queue to see liver specialists. In the future, we may have telehealth services in which patients can consult with liver specialists online. It will greatly improve their access to care,” said Dr Pisit.    "
101,101, APD changes the life of a patient with kidney failure   Tue 09 Febuary 2021  ,"   APD changes the life of a patient with kidney failure   At the beginning of 2021, Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD) was introduced to Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS)’s benefits package to improve the life quality of patients living with chronic kidney disease.   Manee Paintanphol, a patient at Ban Phaeo Hospital in Samut Sakhon Province, is the first UCS beneficiary to receive APD — a treatment for kidney failure with the use of an automated cycler to fill a patient’s abdomen with dialysate, then drains it into a sterile bag, the process that is called ‘exchange.’   Before that, she carried out Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) for two years. It put a burden on her as its method required her to do the exchange four times a day, from 6 am to 11 pm. She must also change five to six bags of dialysate during the process. It made her felt worried and restless.       “Sometimes I fell asleep before 11 pm. Because I’m old and my health is not good. So I missed doing the exchange sometimes. It made my belly swollen,” she said.   Manee’s struggle was observed by her doctor, who suggested her to register for APD request from UCS.   When she started using APD early this year, she could sleep through the night and change only two bags of dialysate a day.   “The doctor set up the machine for me. My job is just to press a green button on the machine and change the dialysate bags,” she said. “Now I could sleep properly and feel stronger.”        Dr Piyathida Jungsaman, a kidney specialist at Ban Phaeo Hospital, said that APD suited patients who have to perform CAPD for a very long time until their abdominal lining is frail, and require them to increase the volume of dialysate.   APD is also for patients with kidney failure who may not be treated by hemodialysis because of their health and financial conditions.   Sakchai Kanjanawatana, Secretary-General of National Health Security Office (NHSO) which oversees UCS, said that CAPD had been provided to UCS beneficiaries since 14 years ago, allowing patients with final-stage kidney failure to survive.    More than 30,000 UCS beneficiaries receive CAPD so far.   APD has been available for beneficiaries of Social Security Scheme and Civil Servant Medical Benefits Scheme, before it is included in UCS benefits package early this year.   NHSO targets to provide APD to at least 100 patients within this year. Currently, more than 173 patients make reservations for APD. Doctors from 20 healthcare units across Thailand expressed their interest in obtaining APD for their patients.     "
102,102, NHSO added new hepatitis C medication to scheme   Tue 09 Febuary 2021  ,"   NHSO added new hepatitis C medication to scheme   The National Health Security Board added sofosbuvir/velpatasvir into Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS)’s benefits package.   Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir is a fixed-dose combination regimen for the treatment of hepatitis C in adults. It is more than 90% effective for all hepatitis C genotypes.   Nimit Tai-udom, NHSO board represents civil society, said that the medication was added into the National List of Essential Medicines, a list of medications used in the hospitals and public health services in Thailand. The medicines will be provided to people with high risks of contracting hepatitis C including HIV-infected persons and injecting drug users.   Disease Control Department director-general Dr Opas Karnkawinpong called hepatitis C “the silent killer.” No symptoms are presented in infected persons until they reach the end stage, leading to cirrhosis and liver cancer.   “In the past, the treatment for each type of hepatitis C required different medication, and the screening test was complex and costly. [Healthcare schemes] did not cover the test for all types hepatitis C, making many infected persons reached unable to access treatment and died eventually,” said Dr Opas.   “Now we have the new medication for all types of hepatitis C in the benefits package. We encourage every risk group to get tests. The faster they get tests, the less likely they would end up in a severe stage.”   The study conducted by Health Intervention and Technology Assessment Program (HITAP) shows that giving sofosbuvir/velpatasvir to 4,000 patients can save 11.14 million baht of spending on lab tests and 45.5 million baht of medication fees, when compared to the conventional testing and medication.   “We can save the budget and increase the treatment access for the risk groups and infected persons,” said NHSO Secretary-General Sakchai Kanjanawatana.   Dr Pisit Tangkijvanich, President of Thai Association for the Study of the Liver, said that the introduction of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir into UCS would help reduce the workload of hepatologists, specialized doctors not widely available in Thailand.     The physicians can prescribe the medication to patients with an early stage of hepatitis C, saving time for hepatologists to focus on severe cases.   He added that Thailand set a target to eliminate hepatitis C by 2030, aligning with the goal set by the World Health Organization (WHO).

103,103, Flu vaccination reduces the burden on healthcare systems   Tue 26 January 2021  ,"   Flu vaccination reduces the burden on healthcare systems   Influenza vaccination program provided by National Health Security Office (NHSO) reduces the burden on healthcare systems while preventing patients with chronic diseases from severe illnesses and death, according to International Health Policy Program (IHPP) under Thai Public Health Ministry.   The finding is part of IHPP’s recent health assessment on “coverage, efficiency, and financial impact of providing influenza vaccination program to risk population groups under national health insurance systems in 2015-2019.”   Dr Supon Limwattananon from IHPP, also a researcher at Khon Kaen University’s Pharmaceutical Sciences Faculty, revealed that the assessment compared health outcomes of people with chronic diseases who had and had not joined the influenza vaccination program in the past five years.   NHSO has funded the program since 2013, targeting risk populations groups such as people with chronic diseases, elderly aged over 65, over four-month pregnant women, children aged between six months and two years, people with obesity, thalassemia, immune deficiency, and cerebral palsy.   It started with giving three million flu shots to the target population groups, before expanding the coverage to four million in recent years. The program covers beneficiaries of every healthcare schemes, including Universal Coverage Scheme, Civil Servants Medical Benefits Scheme and Social Security Scheme.   IHPP’s health assessment found that the hospitalization rate of population group given no flu vaccines were between two and 2.5%, higher than the rate of the group joining influenza vaccination program (between 1.1 and 1.2%) between 2015 and 2019.   The mortality rate of the first group was at 2.8 to 3.5%, and 1.1 to 1.3% for the latter at the same period of time.     Moreover, influenza vaccination program saved health expenditure for Thai government. Medical fees for patients with flu and pneumonitis under hospitalization were reduced by 242.3 million baht in 2015. A similar trend was observed in 2017 and 2019, in which the reimbursement was deducted by 347.8 and 359.6 million baht, respectively.   Around 16.5% of patients with chronic diseases were covered by the vaccination program in 2019. If the coverage was extended to 80%, suggested IHPP, the government would save more than 1.4 billion baht.   “The finding shows the benefits of expanding the influenza vaccination program’s coverage in patients with chronic disease, especially those with stroke, heart disease, diabetes, and kidney failure,” said Dr Supon.   In response to IHPP’s finding, NHSO Deputy Secretary-General Dr Jadej Thammatacharee said that NHSO would consult with experts to expand the coverage of the vaccination program to five million shots this year.   The flu shots are annually given to risk population groups from May to September.

CHF provides emergency funds to LAOs, which launch health promotion and disease prevention projects at the local community level. Examples of the past projects include community-based active case finding, COVID-19 prevention campaign, alcohol gel and face masks distribution to residents. Around 394 LAOs received the grant from CHF fund with 817 implementing projects.         “Free COVID-19 testing and treatment are available for everyone who is potentially exposed to the coronavirus,” said Dr Sakchai.    "

108,108," Independent Complaint Centres raise understanding, curb conflicts over healthcare services   Mon 04 January 2021  ","   Independent Complaint Centres raise understanding, curb conflicts over healthcare services   Complaint centres, especially ones operated by independent bodies, play a key role in improving understanding among service providers and patients and settle disputes over healthcare services under the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS), a seminar was told.   A conflict between a healthcare service provider and a patient normally takes time to deal with and emotionally exhausts both sides, said Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul.   He was addressing a gathering of representatives of hospitals’ UCS complaint units and independent UCS complaint centres on Dec 8, 2020 in Bangkok for a seminar and an annual ceremony held to present awards to them for their past achievements.   The minister congratulated all of them on their awarded successes.   As the National Health Security Office (NHSO) and its partners continue improving the UCS, these complaint units and centres play a key role in educating patients about their rights under the UCS and mediate in a conflict between a service provider and a patient, said Mr. Anutin.   Anytime such a conflict arises, these complaint units and centres step in to help both sides find some common ground in their conflict and end it with satisfaction, he said.   These complaint units and centres are a key mechanism in the continuous improvement of the UCS, said Dr. Sakchai Kanjanawatana, Secretary-General of the NHSO.   Although hospitals in different sizes have different healthcare capacity, they should all be capable of delivering basic healthcare of the same quality, said Dr. Sinchai Tantirattananon, the Director of Public Health Administration Division, Department of Health Service Support, Ministry of Public Health (MoPH).   The MoPH aims to eradicate disparities in access to quality basic healthcare services by 2022, in an action plan that should help lower incidents of conflicts between the service provider and the patient over the quality of services, he said.   Figures of complaints over the healthcare service quality remain high, despite a slight decrease, he said.   A total of 555 such complaints were received by the ministry in 2018, while 430 similar complaints were received in 2019, he said.   Disparities in healthcare services could be divided into two groups, the disparity in access to healthcare services and the disparity in quality of the services provided, said Dr. Theerapol Topanthanont, chairman of the board of the Healthcare Accreditation Institute (HAI).   The HAI is an independent body working to encourage and assist hospitals, both private-run and state-run, to become accredited ones, he said.   After well over two decades since the HAI began its role, so far about 88.82% of state-run hospitals and 39.84% of private-run hospitals are accredited, which means about 70% of all hospitals in this country are now accredited healthcare facilities, he said.   To achieve this healthcare accreditation, hospitals are required to pass an assessment of the standard of healthcare in all nine areas, one of which concerns the safety of healthcare personnel while the rest deal with the safety of patients, he said.   When it comes to adverse events in healthcare, state-run district hospitals are found to have the highest number of cases, he said, citing statistics self-reported by hospitals to the HAI as part of their accreditation.   After all, there are close to a thousand district hospitals in the country while there only a few hundreds of larger hospitals, he said.   Onkanya Phitcha-on, a representative of an independent complaint centre in Pathum Thani, said her centre, funded by the NHSO, started out years ago by communicating with both patients and healthcare providers under the UCS to raise awareness of their rights and responsibilities respectively.   The centre later moved on to a new role of reaching out to the disadvantaged people including Thais whose birth wasn’t registered properly, which resulted in them not having the ID card that is a key document required for the registration under the UCS, she said. Only until recent years when access to healthcare has improved dramatically under the UCS, the number of complaints filed with her centre by patients has begun to rise, she said.   The centre is dealing with a considerably higher number of such complaints when compared with the number of complaints received by a complaint unit run by a state-run hospital itself, she said.   “The reason is these patients feel more comfortable complaining with us about unsatisfied healthcare services they had experienced [than with the hospitals],” she said. Sometimes it simply was all about misunderstanding between the service provider and the patient, she said.   Most recently, she said, a patient vented on Facebook her frustration over a long wait in the emergency ward of a public hospital in Pathum Thani for a wound cleaning service, which she found unacceptable.   As monitoring social media has these days become her centre’s usual active search for complaints about healthcare services under the UCS, Ms. Onkanya found this Facebook post and contacted the patient directly to ask for more information so that she could contact the hospital mentioned in the post and find out what actually happened.   As it turned out, Ms. Onkanya was told by those nurses who were there in the hospital’s emergency ward that day that they thought the complaining patient was likely to be the one who stormed out of the ward while they were trying to save the life of a patient in critical condition.   And when Ms. Onkanya explained that to the patient later, the patient voluntarily deleted her Facebook post against the hospital.   Dr. Sinchai agreed that most patients felt more comfortable with an independent complaint centre than with one operated by a state office, which explained why a considerably higher number of complaints go to these independent centres.   #NHSO #UHC #NHSOThailand #UCSThailand #UHCThailand    "
109,109, Cancer patients under UCS can now choose desired hospitals near them   Mon 04 January 2021  ,"  Cancer patients under UCS can now choose desired hospitals near them   It is every patient’s dream to be in good hands of oncologists at one of the country’s most reputable medical institutions, when diagnosed with cancer. That explains why queues at these cancer-treating facilities are usually lengthy while cancer treatment can’t really wait.   For this reason, the government has come up with a new policy to equip more hospitals with expensive medical devices for and a medical team trained specifically on cancer treatment so that patients who are diagnosed with cancer in any parts of the country have more choices than key cancer-treating hospitals and institutions in Bangkok to choose from.     The ambition in this major step to improve the country’s cancer treatment and care system is to allow all cancer patients under the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) to browse through a list of hospitals and medical institutions capable of treating cancer near them as their choices as if they are booking a cinema ticket online, said Dr. Somsak Akksilp, Director-General of the Department of Medical Services (DMS).   Each year between 120,000 and 140,000 are diagnosed with cancer, or approximately 120 per 100,000 people, while between 70,000 and 80,000 people died of cancer every year, said Dr. Sura Wisedsak, Deputy Permanent Secretary of the Public Health Ministry.   The most common cancer in Thailand are liver cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer and cervical cancer, he said, adding that the rates of new cases of these cancers are rising gradually.   In response to the country’s cancer situation, the ministry has been improving its cancer care system with a comprehensive array of diagnostic capabilities and treatment therapies nationwide so that cancer patients in other provinces no longer have to travel all the way to Bangkok for an effective treatment, he said.   All 12 health regions of the ministry are now equipped with high-tech attack cancer machines and a sufficient number of oncologists and other healthcare workers trained specifically on cancer care. Although hospitals in these health regions may not have the newest cancer treatment technology those University hospitals have, they can now offer cancer treatment with a good standard, he said.   “I understand that everyone is worried and want the best quality of cancer treatment when told he or she has cancer. But wouldn’t it be better for all cancer patients if they can choose to receive treatment at a good cancer-treating hospital closer to their home?” he said.   The challenge is how to get all hospitals offering cancer treatment to share information among them to ensure every cancer patient in any parts of the country receives cancer treatment seamlessly, he said.    Some cancer patients look for a hospital capable of treating cancer that is closest to their homes, while others prefer a University hospital no matter how far it is from where they live, said Sirinthip Khattiyakan, president of Thai Cancer Society (TCS).   “However, they may not be aware that those well-known top-notch doctors, too, have 24 hours a day as do other oncologists who actually are as good as them,” she said.   In this case, the TCS has a role in sharing necessary information about cancer treatment and others experiences by patients from different hospitals among patients and their families, also encouraging them to choose the most convenient choice with good quality of treatment, she said.   Three key elements in successful cancer treatment therapies depends on the good quality of care or treatment, the speed of treatment, the ongoing-evaluation and continuity of treatment, said Dr. Somsak.   “As a former cancer patient myself, I totally understand just how every patient desperately wants treatment with good quality,” said Dr. Somsak who had previously been diagnosed with, treated for and fully recovered from lymphoma of the nasal cavity.   In supporting the implementation of a policy by Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul to allow cancer patients to choose a desired cancer-treating healthcare facility, the Department of Medical Services and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) have jointly developed some technology innovation, said Dr. Somsak.   First, the facility mapping concerning cancer treatment resources each hospital has such as the radiotherapy equipment, which allows every hospital taking part in this cancer treatment system to see what equipment at which hospital is available for use and when, he said.   Second, development of Thai Cancer Based (TCB) Plus, a computer program that supports referral of a cancer patient from hospital to another nationwide, he said.   Third, the development of “The 1”, an online-based platform to allow hospitals, including University hospitals, to book cancer treatment queues online within just a few clicks, he said.   Fourth, the training of hospital cancer coordinators whose main responsibility is to assist cancer patients to choose a suitable and desired cancer-treating facility using the TCB Plus and The 1 platform, he said.   The other work is the development of a mobile application to allow patients to gain access to a data set containing details of their cancer treatment including medicines prescribed to them, he said.   All these patients have to do is download into their mobile phones. The application available for both Android and iOS operating systems, and connect it to the TCB Plus and The 1, he said.   These patients will no longer need to carry with them their paper-based medical records to hospitals to where they are referred for cancer treatment as their records and referral documents will be sent to the concerned hospitals electronically, he said.   The new cancer treatment system is estimated to require 880 million baht in additional budgeting per year, which the National Health Security Office (NHSO) has already set aside for this purpose, said Dr. Jakkrit Ngowsiri, Deputy Secretary-General of the NHSO.   He assured all patients and hospitals participating in this cancer treatment programme that the budget prepared for this programme is sufficient.   The NHSO believes this programme will maximise the efficiency of the country’s cancer treatment and decrease the number of deaths caused by cancer, he said.   This new cancer treatment system will help the country maximise cancer treatment resources and achieve a better overall outcome of cancer treatment, said Associate Professor Surasak Leelaudomdipi, President of University Hospital Network (UhosNet).   “Overall, this system will make the investment in new cancer treatment technology by all cancer-treating facilities worth it. A unit of radiotherapy equipment, for instance, cost several hundreds million baht and it should be used as much as possible to make it worth investing,” he said.    Because cancer is the number one killer in Thailand, the government always gives a priority to the continuous development of the treatment system, said Mr. Anutin.   But despite how advanced cancer treatment resources have become over the past years, lengthy queues at the country’s main cancer-treating hospitals remained a major hindrance to the improvement in access by all cancer patients to quality treatment, he said.   That is why the government has come up with this new cancer treatment system that will improve convenience for an access of patients to standard cancer treatment, he said.   “As a New Year gift to all Thais, the new cancer treatment programme is now ready to begin from Jan 1, 2021,” he said.

110,110, NHSO joins the national effort to end AIDS by 2030   Tue 15 December 2020  ,"   NHSO joins the national effort to end AIDS by 2030   December 1, 2020 — National Health Security Office (NHSO) joins the national effort to end AIDS by 2030 and vowed to improve benefits package for people living with HIV.   On World AIDS Day, Department of Disease Control under Public Health Ministry launched a campaign “Walk Together: AIDS, live together, end stigma” to encourage multi-sectoral collaboration on changing society’s perception toward people living with HIV.   World AIDS Day takes place on 1 December each year, an occasion for people worldwide to show their solidarity in fighting AIDS and support HIV patients.        Dr. Rattaphon Triamwichanon, assistance to NHSO secretary-general, said that NHSO had joined the campaign and participated in the National AIDS Strategy 2017–2030, which target to end the AIDS epidemic in Thailand by 2030.    NHSO, which oversees the Universal Heath scheme (UCS), has worked closely with the Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO) to distribute free antiretroviral drugs to HIV patients and support the movement to end discrimination and stigma against people living with HIV.   Since the introduction of HIV and AIDS services in the UCS benefits package in 2005, many services have been developed and improved to ensure patients’ access to blood tests and antiretroviral treatment. The services include;   -Access to free antiretroviral medication regardless of CD4 count. -Antiretroviral drugs for the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission. -Antigen/antibody test -HIV monitoring program -Hepatitis C virus testing and treatment -Tuberculosis radiology for every new HIV patient -Access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Providing free PrEP to people at high risk of getting HIV is piloted in 2020, targeting 2,000 people in 50 health units across Thailand. The target will be increased to 5,000 people in 153 units in 2021.   -Reach-Recruit-Test-Treat- Retain (RRTTR) service package targeting 77,000 HIV patients in 2020 and 105,000 in 2021.     According to NHSO data, HIV and AIDS services are provided to 309,169 patients under UCS in 2020. Ninety-one percent of them have received antiretroviral treatment, while 73 percent are reported to have effective treatments. They can sustain HIV viral suppression and gain immunological recovery.   The Thai government has increased the budget for HIV and AIDS services each year. In 2021, NHSO receives around 3.67 billion baht to cover HIV and AIDS services under UCS, increases from 3.59 billion baht in the previous year.   “Management of HIV and AIDS services reflects the collaboration across multi sectors, including public and private sectors and civil society, making the AIDS situation in Thailand improves,” said Dr. Rattaphon.   “However, discrimination and stigma against people living with HIV still exist. We believe that working on a campaign such as Walk Together will lead to the end of discrimination and stigma soon.”         "
111,111, Thailand rises as the forefront of global health agenda    Fri 11 December 2020  ,"  December 9, 2020 — Universal Health Coverage (UHC) is an essential element in building strong health systems, strengthening health emergency response, and the corporation among global communities.    In celebrating the International UHC Day, National Health Security Office (NHSO) in collaboration with Thailand's Foreign Affairs Ministry and Public Health Ministry held a panel to discuss the role of UHC in strengthening human and health security. The lesson learned was taken from the global communities’ and Thailand’s experiences in managing the coronavirus pandemic.   Thailand introduced UHC in 2002 after Thai governments had aggressively expanded healthcare facilities in rural areas and trained health workforce for over two decades.       “Our strong health systems is a result of our long-year commitment in health development and investment,” said NHSO secretary-general Dr Sakchai Kanjanawatana during the Tuesday panel at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.   “UHC is the result of that commitment, and it is one of the major reasons that help us coping with the COVID-19 pandemic effectively.”   UHC allowed the Thai government to mobilize resources, especially health funding, to support health emergency response. NHSO, which has received UHC budget from Thai government annually, can diverse the funding to necessary health services, including free COVID-19 testing and treatment provided to Thais and foreigners living in Thailand.   Mobilizing health funding also enables Thailand to increase coronavirus laboratories from two to over 200 labs in different locations within a few months, and support local governments and communities in conducting COVID-19 surveillance in their areas.   “Some new services were launched during the height of the pandemic, including telemedicine and [NHSO] mobile application that provides consultation to UHC members. These would never happen if we don’t have resources under UHC,” said Dr Sakchai.     Build health capacity and networks  “The role of UHC does not only focus on human rights. It’s also a critical element of pandemic preparedness and health security in general,” said Dr Richard Brown from the World Health Organization, Thailand Office.   “It’s very hard to think of any countries that have managed to effectively control the pandemic that does not have UHC enshrined as one of the major health policies.”   However, he added that some countries with strong UHC had also failed to control the pandemic effectively. One of the examples is the United Kingdom (UK) that established National Health Service in 1946 to provide free healthcare access to every British citizen.   “The UK has roughly the same population as Thailand, and the trajectory of COVID-19 has been very different. Not really what I have expected,” he said.   “Part of the answer to this is, although we have strong UHC in the UK. We probably have not paid sufficient attention to developing health security in the same way Thailand has done. I think it’s interesting in Thailand where you can point at individual areas where capacity can be strengthened.”   Dr Sura Wisetsak, Deputy permeant secretary of Thailand’s Public Health Ministry, said during the panel that Thailand had put effort into strengthening primary healthcare to close the gap between geographical areas.    In the last 40 decades, Public Health Ministry has established pervasive networks of hospitals at regional, provincial, and district levels. It has also built the capacity of village health volunteers who play a role as a connector between local communities and health providers.   With strong health networks and partnerships with multi-stakeholders, said Dr Sura, winning COVID-19 is possible.   “The pandemic has shown us that leaving health workforce to handle with the disease control is not enough,” said Soontri Hatti Sengking, President of the Foundation for Labour and Employment Promotion.   “Ensuring people’s participation in health promotion and disease prevention is essential to close the gap in health systems and strengthen the country’s capacity to deal with the health crisis.”    Forefront of the global health agenda   Thailand began its journey toward global health cooperation since many decades ago. Solid cooperation has been established with the United States, one of Thailand’s major partner countries for over 40 years.     Dr John R. MacArthur, the CDC Southeast Asia Regional Office’s Regional Director, said that Thailand and the United States had collaborated in many areas, including surveillance, research, workforce, and laboratory. Both countries have worked together to set up the first international Field Epidemiology Training The program aims to build the capacity of health workforce in many countries.     Nadhavathna Krishnamra, Director-General, Department of International Organization, Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Thailand had started its health diplomacy as early as the 1990s and became the forefront of global health security agenda.     Since 2007, Thailand in partnership with six countries including Brazil, France, Indonesia, Norway, Senegal, and South Africa that co-founded the Foreign Policy and Global Health (FPGH) group had proposed a resolution at the UN General Assembly to recognize the importance of UHC to global health agenda.     Its resolution adopted in 2012, following by UHC being embedded in Goal 3 of the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015. In partnership with FPGH, Thailand also proposed a resolution to establish International UHC Day, which was adopted at the 72nd session of the UN General Assembly in 2017.   “We are particularly grateful to push UHC on the global agenda as well as the national agenda. We are sharing the perspective of UHC as it relates to COVID-19 and the challenges today,” said Mr Nadhavathna.   “UHC and COVID-19 remind us of the truth that no one is safe until everyone is safe, that UHC in Thailand is a strong guarantee of a robust health system for the Thai people and those living in Thailand.   But, also, it is a platform of cooperation with countries elsewhere particularly neighboring countries where they need to strengthen their own health system.”    "
112,112, NHSO was awarded for promoting participation to ensure healthcare access under UHC   Fri 11 December 2020  ,"  December 10, 2020 — National Health Security Office (NHSO) won the ASEAN regional award for promoting participation to ensure healthcare access under Universal Health Coverage (UHC).   The award was given during the 37th ASEAN Social Security Association (ASSA) virtual board meeting chaired by Cambodia on 9 December. ASSA is a platform of cooperation for promoting social and health security and sharing experience among ten ASEAN member states.   NHSO, represented by its secretary-general Dr Sakchai Kanjanawatana during the meeting, received an award in a category Continuous Improvement Recognition Award for promoting participation and financial support in various activities under Thai UHC.   The organization has operated the Community Health Fund that provides financial support to local governments and communities to initiate health promotion and disease prevention programs. Their initiatives played a big part in controlling the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.   With NHSO's support, local government and communities could conduct disease surveillance and trace COVID-19 suspected cases. They also launched campaigns to educate their neighbors about the symptoms of COVID-19 and the methods to protect the communities from the virus.   Some part of the fund was used to support village health volunteers, who put consistent efforts into tracing and monitoring suspected cases in their residing area, in collaboration with local administration organizations and hospital operators.   Moreover, NHSO has supported social innovation at a community level, one of which is the collaboration between small-scale pharmacies and state hospitals to deliver drugs and medical supplies to patients.   Patients can reduce the time and expenses for traveling to hospitals while reducing the risk from exposure to the coronavirus.

113,113," Early detection of kidney disease saves lives, money and increase quality of life   Fri 13 November 2020  ","    Early detection of kidney disease saves lives, money and increase quality of life.    Better access to kidney disease together with public education about kidney failure prevention is the key to success in curbing rising demand for high-cost kidney dialysis and other related types of medical treatment, a seminar was told recently.   The National Health Security Office (NHSO) along with King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, consumer rights protection advocacy groups and associations of kidney patients is calling on the government to approve a proposal to include self-screening tests for kidney disease into the core benefit package of the universal coverage (UCS) scheme, said Dr. Rattaphon Triamwichanon, Assistant Secretary-General of the NHSO.    He was speaking at a seminar entitled “No more premature deaths from kidney failure”. The seminar was organised by the NHSO in Bangkok on Sept 18, 2020.   The kidney disease screening test is a crucial element to ensure that patients with the disease receive proper treatment to slow down disease progression, he said.   Patients with high blood pressure or diabetes and overweight people in particular need to be screened for kidney disease, given their high risk of developing the disease, he said, adding that if early detected, kidney disease won’t unnecessarily have to develop into kidney failure.   There also are some types of kidney disease known to be inherited, which normally are found in young patients, he said.   The NHSO is compiling information about the costs of treating patients with chronic kidney disease and kidney failure for submission along with the proposal to include kidney disease screening tests into the UCS’s core benefit package, he said.   Since kidney disease test kits still aren’t available at affordable prices in Thailand, the only way to get such a test is request for it at a hospital, which normally isn’t easy to get, he said.   “As a nephrologist I think the NHSO has well paved the way for ensuring sufficient treatment for patients with kidney failure,” said Assoc Prof Dr Nattachai Srisawat, head of King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital’s centre for medical excellence in critical renal disease treatment.    “And now it’s time to move forward to focusing on detecting kidney disease in its early stages, which will possibly improve the kidney disease situation in Thailand,” he said. It will definitely be better for anyone to know that he or she has kidney disease in its early stages rather than in the end stage, he said.   “No one ever wants to hear that death sentence,” he said, referring to the end-stage kidney disease.   Assoc Prof Dr Nattachai said a research team at Faculty of Medicine of Chulalongkorn University is developing a cheaper version of imported kidney disease test kits, in a two-year research project funded by Health Systems Research Institute (HSRI).   The test kit being developed had already been tested on the first group of 100 volunteers, he said.   The test kit will be next tested on a larger number of volunteers to ensure its efficiency before the prototype will be given to any private manufacturers interested in mass-producing it, he said.   As for public education about kidney disease, he said, there already is a very active network of kidney patients in the country to help support the work of disseminating useful information about the disease to the public.   Thanaphon Dokkaeo, president of Kidney Disease Friends' Association of Thailand, said the association now has more than 60,000 members who are patients with kidney disease, academics and individuals interested in information about kidney disease.   The association is highly active on the social media in its efforts to reach out to the people who may need correct information about kidney disease, from prevention to treatment, said Mr Thanaphon.   The association also operates a hotline to ensure access to the assistance it is providing around the clock and works together with its partners across the country including tambon health promotion hospitals and teaching hospitals to help kidney patients in all parts of the country, he said.   More Buddhist monks are being encouraged to become members of the association after it had learned that a large number of monks who have kidney disease weren’t receiving proper care due to their lack of information necessary for kidney patients to take care of themselves at home, he said.   “The association serves voluntarily as a one-stop service centre for everyone who needs help or looks for information about kidney disease,” he said.

114,114," Clinic crisis prompts primary care reform for better access, quality   Thu 29 October 2020  ","     Clinic crisis prompts primary care reform for better access, quality   The primary health care system under the universal coverage scheme (UCS) in Bangkok has been thrown into chaos after about 190 privately-owned clinics serving as primary care units under the scheme in the city were excluded from the health care network over fraud allegations.   As a result, the existing UCS health care facilities are being flooded with patients who used to receive services at the banned clinics and forced to extend office hours to cope with a surge in a number of new patients.   Many of them are complaining about the inconvenience and long queues at new health care units.   In response to this crisis, the National Health Security System (NHSO) is racing against time to lessen the impact of the problem on both patients and health care units while at the same time attempting to reform Bangkok’s primary care system under the UHC scheme. Redesign of the primary care system   A new structure of Bangkok’s primary care system has already been designed to improve quality and accountability of contracted health care units, while new clinics are being recruited into the redesigned primary care system, said Dr Jadej Thammatacharee, Deputy Secretary-General of the NHSO.   By Nov 1 the NHSO expects to include at least 500 new clinics into Bangkok’s primary care network under the UCS and patients will then be allowed to choose and register their desired new primary care units through various channels including by phone, smartphone application, and contact any of these primary care units in person, he said.   “We expect the new system to run smoothly in about two months from now,” he said. The new primary care network in each health area of the city will consist of three components, namely a primary care unit, a regular care unit and a referral unit.   The primary care unit is a privately-owned clinic while the regular health care unit could be either a Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) public health service centre or a hospital, which could be either a state-run hospital or privately-owned one, he said. The referral unit is a hospital capable of handling referral by admitting a patient to it for treatment or transferring him or her to a larger hospital if necessary, he said, adding that the referral unit will in the future possibly be developed into a cluster of hospitals, not necessarily a single hospital any more, to provide more choices to patients. The new role of regular health care unit   Although the budget will be allocated directly to all of these health care units, as usual, the regular health care unit will also have a new role in helping the NHSO with controlling the quality of health care services offered by clinics in the same primary care network, he said.   Dr Panrudee Manomaipibul, director of Department of Health of Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, said all 69 public health centres under the department will take an important role in assisting the NHSO to ensure service quality of these privately-owned clinics, which is part of the ongoing primary care system reform.   So far 47 out of these 69 centres are offering services in extra office hours until 8 pm daily, to cope with a surge in demand following the exclusion of the 190 clinics, she said, adding that more centres will manage to extend their office hours too as the BMA will have to take up more of the more than 2 million people who previously registered with the excluded clinics. Dr Jadej also stressed the need to build up trust in the importance and quality of the primary care system, a key element in a sustainable health security system.   An indicator of the primary care system development being successful is that patients are receiving care at health care units closet to their homes and hospitals are no longer crowded, he said.   Freedom of choice   From Jan 1 next year onwards, patients will be allowed to change their primary care units more freely and immediately and without having to wait for 15 days as in the past system, and can change 4 times/per year for easier to access the health services for their health need, he said.   Sometimes, they may want to change to a new primary health care unit closer to their workplaces rather than their homes, said Dr Panrudee.   Bhumibol Adulyadej Hospital, a tertiary hospital in the northern part of Bangkok that is seen as an excellent model of successful primary care network development, is also being affected by the clinic exclusion crisis.   The hospital is now struggling to handle an overwhelming number of patients seeking treatment for a common health condition such as a common cold and stomach pain at its outpatient ward again, said AVM Dr Thaweepong Pajareya, director of the hospital.   Despite its remarkable success in cutting the number of hospital visits by 80% with the help of a highly effective primary health care network, which serves around 300,000 people in four districts, the hospital was abruptly back to square one again when the clinics in its network were suddenly excluded following the fraud scandal.   Never lose faith in the primary care system   After all, the hospital director strongly believes a good primary health care network is the solution to this problem, learning from the hospital’s past experience and success. He also is seeing this reform of the NHSO’s primary health care system as a good opportunity to push for all other primary health care networks in Bangkok to adopt e-Referral, an information technology-based referral system the hospital has developed and been using.   With e-Referral, about 90% of the referral data is processed electronically, which is something AVM Dr Thaweepong now hopes to see in all other parts of Bangkok as well.   “We should really be thankful for this crisis (the abrupt exclusion of 190 clinics) which has led to the reform of the primary care system and hopefully will eventually make the ambition to bring quality health care closer to home become true,” said Sujin Rungsawang, a member of a sub-committee on health security in Health Region 13 of Bangkok.   When good quality health care services are available in every community, people will save a lot of money and time they now spend on travelling to the hospital, said Ms Sujin who is also the president of a coordination centre for informal workers.   “We have to admit that the promise to bring quality health care closer to our home has not really happened just yet, so we still have to travel all the way to the hospital,” she said.

Spoke at an online panel on the global response to the coronavirus infection, held by the Asian Pacific Society of Health Support Science on 11 September, Dr Sakchai highlighted the crucial roles of UHC in strengthening Thailand's health resilience during the global pandemic.  The panel was joined by multinational health experts, including those from Germany, France, and China.  As of early September, the number of daily confirmed cases in Thailand has declined. The death toll has been halted since June and remained at 53 deceases — following the Thai government's implementation of effective measures to flatten the curve.  ""The key measure of our implementation stems from a combination of public health and social measures,"" said Dr Sakchai during the panel.  Several public health measures are implemented, he clarified, including setting up active surveillance units, conducting disease screening and tracing in local communities, hospitals, and the venues for both local and state quarantine.  The Thai government has ensured people's accessibility to health facilities, aid Dr Sakchai. Medical equipment and supplies are provided to healthcare workers, many of whom are well-trained in primary care.  Since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, the Thai government launched the Center for COVID-19 Situation Administration as a platform for fostering collaboration among authorities, health experts and civil society organizations, while having a daily press conference to update the situation for public audiences.  Physical distancing and personal hygiene are promoted through the government's implementation of emergency decree, public space lockdown and the introduction of campaigns encouraging people to wear masks and wash their hands.  The government also provided subsidies to vulnerable populations, including unemployed and informal workers who lost income during the city lockdown.  ""The UHC is one of the fundamental keys to our success. It [allows us to] provide timely response to COVID-19 and other related essential health services without discrimination.  The UHC helps people in Thailand access health services when needed. People can access free-of-charge coronavirus screening, testing, treatment, and quarantine,"" said Dr Sakchai.  ""All expenses of essential health services and interventions related to COVID-19 are fully covered by Thai UHC — to protect everyone on the Thai soil from financial hardships, and to leave no one behind.""  He said that the UHC allowed the Thai government to mobilize health finance for COVID-19 emergency response.  Some other programs, such as the local health security fund is an essential mechanism that increase the capacity of local communities, their leaders, and health village volunteers in performing a wide range of disease prevention and health promotion activities during the outbreak.  Dr Sakchai added that the NHSO and Public Health Ministry had collaborated with private and public laboratory centers across Thailand to conduct COVID-19 testing.  ""This pandemic creates 'New Normal' and prompts us to involve new technology and social innovation in improving the UHC,"" he said.  ""The necessity of social distancing during the pandemic has shown the potential of virtual care, such as telemedicine and online consultation.""  Learning from the pandemic, the NHSO plans to increase the telemedicine services and promote partnerships with multi-stakeholders in service delivery.  ""Thailand has learned important lessons from fighting the pandemic. First, the COVID-19 fosters the importance of the UHC. The strong and resilient national health systems and the UHC are the foundation for effective emergency responses to the public health crisis,"" he concluded.  ""The UHC is also key to enhancing global health security and in realizing the Sustainable Development Goals. We can learn from each other so we can do better. Together, with commitment and determination, UHC can become a reality for all.""    "
117,117, NHSO mobile application launched for the UCS registration   Thu 17 September 2020  ," Members of the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) can manage their registration of health units on a newly-launched mobile phone application.   Dr Phanomwan Boonyamanop, the acting director of Bureau of Registration at the National Health Security Office (NHSO), said that the NHSO had launched the mobile application on 1 Aug for making the UCS registration procedure more convenient for its members.   “Before, when the UCS members move the new cities, they must submit paper-based documents for registration at the new health units,” said Dr Phanomwan. “Now they can register on the mobile application and proceed the registration online.”   The mobile application, called ""NHSO"", can be downloaded on both IOS and Android. The UCS members must identify themselves when using the application for the first time. They will be requested to go through two-factor authentication which takes them only a few minutes.   The application has multi-functions that provide the users' access to information about the benefits package of UCS members and their eligibility for medical services. They can also register for changing health units through the application.   According to the rule, UCS members are automatically assigned to health units close to their registered addresses. If they move to new cities, they are required to register with the new health units near their new residential area.   To complete the registration process, they can upload supporting documents on the NHSO application without visiting the health units. They can change health units four times a year.   “The NHSO will promote the application among the UCS beneficiaries. We hope that more people will use it. It's very convenient and time-saving when using the application for health unit registration,” said Dr Phanomwan.   “We've made a VDO clip for guiding the application users. They can be sure that the application is secured and user-friendly.”   NHSO will request another 148 million baht from the government's stimulus package to provide compensation to health workers in case of illness, disability or death that is related to performing work duties during the pandemic.    Moreover, many workers have lost jobs during the pandemic, expelling them from the Social Security Scheme that insures employers only.   According to Thailand's insurance system, jobless workers will be automatically transferred from the Social Security Scheme to the UHC scheme that guarantees healthcare access to vulnerable populations including unemployed persons and informal workers.     It' s estimated that more than 990,000 workers will become the UHC beneficiaries in post-COVID-19. The NHSO will request 3.68 billion baht from the government's stimulus package to cover healthcare services for these workers.   NHSO will spend the requesting budget in worthwhile activities and services, with the best efficiency, for the best of UHC beneficiaries.   Social Security Scheme beneficiaries received testing covered by the NHSO the most, accounting to 52.31% of the tests, follow by UHC 28.86% and Civil Servant Healthcare Benefits 14.88%. The rest of the tests was for people with other healthcare packages, including private health insurance.   One by three of the tests were conducted for people living in Bangkok, the hardest-hit province by the coronavirus.   As the outbreak is unlikely to end soon, the NHSO targets to provide 1.4 million tests by the end of this year, and other 3.25 million in next year.   NHSO also prepares a 1.32-billion-baht budget for providing COVID-19 vaccine to four million people when it becomes available. Currently, global pharmaceutical companies are developing the vaccine and making good progress.     Dr Phanomwan Boonyamanop, the acting director of Bureau of Registration at the National Health Security Office (NHSO) "
118,118, Thailand supplies diphtheria anti-toxin to Myanmar   Wed 16 September 2020  ,"   Thailand shipped 300 vials of diphtheria anti-toxin to the Shan State of Myanmar, in an attempt to provide humanitarian aids that can save people from a deadly disease.      Dr Rattaphon Triamwichanon, Assistance Secretary-General of Thailand's National Health Security Office (NHSO) said that the World Health Organization (WHO) Country Office for Myanmar informed the NHSO, through WHO Thailand, ""an unusual cluster"" of diphtheria cases had been detected in Eastern Shan State.   Myanmar's Ministry of Health and Sports was conducting a rapid risk assessment and urgently required for the supply of 300 vials of diphtheria anti-toxin.   After receiving the request on 27 Aug, the NHSO took an immediate action by contacting Ramathibodi Poison Center — a unit of Ramathibodi Hospital that collaborates with the NHSO in the Thai National Antidote Project of Thailand (TNAP) for securing necessary antidotes and antivenoms.   The center, which is located in Bangkok, also acts as the WHO Collaborating Centre for the Prevention and Control of Poisoning.    Its team was able to ship diphtheria anti-toxin to Myanmar on the same day of the request arrival. The vials left Bangkok for Chiang Rai where local Thai health official sent them to Shan State via Thai-Myanmar border.   ""The incident shows the multi-sectorial collaboration that aims to save people's lives. Previously, we shipped medicines to many other countries as part of our effort to provide humanitarian aids,"" said Dr Rattaphon.   ""While the coronavirus is ravaging the world, other communicable diseases continue spreading in many countries where local communities can't access treatment. Our collaboration helps fill this gap.""   Diphtheria is a severe infection caused by strains of bacteria called Corynebacterium diphtheria. It can lead to difficulty breathing, heart failure, paralysis, and death.   The diphtheria bacteria spread from person to person through respiratory droplets or touching infected open sores, making people living in the dense-population communities get the risk of contracting to the disease. It can be prevented by vaccination.   The success of TNAP was recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO), which encouraged Thailand to expand the project to a regional level under iCAPS program, or Initiation for Coordinated Antidotes Procurement in Southeast Asia. Thailand has shipped antidotes to its partner countries since then.   In 2018, Thailand sent botulinum antitoxin to threat three patients in Nigeria. One died, unfortunately. Two were in an intensive care unit when WHO representative in Nigeria notified Thailand about the case.   ""TNAP reflects the capacity of Thailand in procuring and securing orphan drugs for both domestic and international patients,   ""Shipping medicines to our partner countries is an important mission. It shows our effort to provide humanitarian aids while maintaining good relationships with our partner nations.""    "
119,119, UCS needs better support for primary care access   Wed 16 September 2020  ,"  Access to primary care plays a crucial role in improving the outcomes of the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS).   According to World Health Organization, primary care aims to ""improve health outcomes through health services that are integrated, coordinated and respond to individual- and population-level health needs.""   National Health Security Office (NHSO), a Thai government agency operating the UCS, has been aware of the role of primary care.   Therefore, it put great effort in strengthening the capacity of health providers and local communities who act as the first contact point of patients within a healthcare system.   However, Nimit Tian-udom, the NHSO board member representing civic groups, pointed out that there was still the gap that prevents UCS beneficiaries from primary care access. He raised the challenge in the beneficiary registration system, in which UCS members are automatically assigned to health units based on their address specified in their house registration document.   The NHSO allows them to request the changing of assigned health units, in case they move to live or work in other areas.   But Nimit said that in the crowded city areas, such as in Bangkok, the UCS members couldn't register at the hospitals nearby their residing areas. Because most of the hospitals are overcrowding, and they have limited quotas for UCS members.   Therefore, most UCS members get hospitals far from their residing areas, creating difficulty for them to reach out to primary care.     Moreover, they need to obtain certificates from local community leaders or the owners of their places when applying for a new health unit --- which they find it's hard to reach those people.  Though they succeed in changing the health units, they need to wait for 15 days until they can request health services from health providers.     ""These are the challenges in the UCS registration system that should be addressed and solved as soon as possible,"" said Nimit.   ""We should focus on building the strength of primary care while fixing a system to make people reach primary care easily.""   "
120,120, Lamphun Hospital reduces waiting hours     Wed 16 September 2020  ," Lamphun Hospital displays the successful story of  the ""medicine pick-up near home"" program, in which patients covered by the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) can pick up medicine from community pharmacies near their home without spending the whole day at the hospital.   The hospital launched the program in Oct last year. Since then, it has established a network with 22 community pharmacies that deliver medicines to 937 UCS patients across Lamphun province.   Dr Pongsak Sophon, the hospital director, said that his hospital had experienced overcrowding wards for many years. With around 1,300 visits a day, patients must wait for at least half a day to complete the hospital visit procedure --- from seeing doctors, getting prescriptions to picking up medicines at the pharmacy unit.   ""We saw the need to improve our services, prompting us to launch the medicine pick-up near home program for patients with chronic diseases including diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and mental health,"" said Dr Pongsak.   ""The program reduces the patients' waiting time at the pharmacy unit from 32 to 19 minutes, or reduce 37% of their waiting time. We've planned to integrate other services such as telemedicine, telepharmacy, medicine home delivery, and robot dispensing soon."" Medicine pick-up near home program is initiated by the UCS operator National Health Security Office (NHSO), Public Health Ministry and the network of community pharmacists with an effort to reduce overcrowding at state-own hospitals across Thailand.   They've experimented with three methods of medicine delivery to patients. First Model, hospital operators supply medicine to community pharmacies, where patients pick up their medicine without visiting hospitals. This method suits patients who have stable health conditions, and who are not required to see doctors.     Second model, patients who are required to visit hospitals can get prescriptions from doctors. Then hospital operators will send medicine to community pharmacies near patients' homes, instead of them waiting for an hour at the hospitals' pharmacy department.    Third model, community pharmacists manage and supply medicine to patients according to their medical records or prescription.    Lamphun Hospital has achieved the first method. It will start trying the third one next month.   ""Our success comes from a strong collaboration between the hospital executives and staff at the pharmacy department. We also did public relations to encourage patients to join the program,"" said Sompong Kamsan, the pharmacist at Lamphun Hospital.   ""Our next step will be the extension of the program's target groups to patients with more diverse chronic diseases. We'll also improve our ICT operation to link the information between our hospital and community pharmacies.""   Recently, the staff of the NHSO and Health Systems Research Institute visited Lamphun Hospital to learn the progress made by the hospital.    ""The medicine pick-up near home program does not just reduce overcrowding at the hospital. It also reduces patients' waiting hours and their cost of traveling to the hospital. Moreover, patients can have more time to consult with the community pharmacists about their medications,"" said Dr Suwit Wibulpolprasert from the Health Systems Research Institute.   Up to date, more than 130 public hospitals and 1,033 community pharmacies joined the program.

121,121, Ramathibodi Hospital: Making efforts to grow telehealth services    Wed 26 August 2020  ," The necessity of social distancing and self-isolation rules during the COVID-19 outbreak has forced health providers to adapt their services. This is no exception for Ramathibodi Hospital, a university hospital providing super tertiary care in Bangkok.   ""We must change our way of thinking. Before, we encouraged people to see doctors at our hospital. Now we encourage them to improve health literacy so they'll have abilities to look after their heath at home,"" said Dr Surasak Leelaudomlipi, Director of Ramathibodi Hospital.   ""We've experimented some homecare programs in recent years. The COVID-19 outbreak has pushed us to accelerate our effort.""   With more than 2.2 millions of visits a year, Ramathibodi Hospital has initiated homecare services for bedridden patients and home-chemotherapy treatment.   ""Our staff have discussed launching a medicine home delivery service for some times. But when COVID-19 hit Bangkok, it took us only two weeks to decide and prepare for it. We launched the service on 1 Apr during the peak of the outbreak,"" said Dr Surasak.   It was about the same time that the hospital staff introduced telemedicine services. Patients can avoid risk from contracting to the coronavirus while traveling to the hospital.   ""We needed to redesign our healthcare services and get acceptance from our physicians. This is the real 'new normal' for us,"" said Dr Atiporn Ingsathit, deputy director of Ramathibodi Hospital.   More than 5,000 patients, or equivalent to 5% of patients requesting medical services in the last two months, have consulted with the hospital staff through telemedicine. Ramathibodi Hospital plans to increase the shares up to 20% in the near future, said Dr Atiporn.   Telemedicine is organized by having physicians who classify patients base on their health conditions. Patients who have stable conditions are classified as 'Green.' Their appointments with doctors can be delayed, or their cases can be referred to community hospitals near their homes.   Patients with stable conditions but require regular consultants are classified as 'Yellow,' which are the main target for telemedicine service. Patients classified as 'Red' are the ones with unstable conditions. They must visit the hospital even though during the pandemic.    After grouping the patients, physicians pass the information to nurses and the medical record department, of which staff will confirm addresses and phone numbers of patients. Then the hospital staff informs patients about their appointment date via SMS.   Patients can consult physicians via phone calls or VDO call applications. After their consultation sessions end, doctors will upload prescriptions of each case into the hospital's database system.   A finance department will then send medical bills to patients via online platforms, and the latter pay through the e-payment system. Finally, the hospital's pharmacists will ship medicine to patients' addresses the next day.   Dr Jadej Thammathacharee, the NHSO deputy secretary-general, said that Ramathibodi Hospital was a role model for health providers that had been proactive and adaptive to the health crisis.    The hospital also provides health services to beneficiaries of Universal Health Coverage, Thai government's healthcare scheme that guarantees healthcare access to more than 49 million Thais.   The NHSO has encouraged health providers at every level, not just the university hospitals like Ramathibodi Hospital, to launch telemedicine and medicine home delivery services. They can reimburse the cost of service from the NHSO.   ""We've supported health providers that are adaptive to the new challenges. Their innovation for health services will improve the quality of healthcare delivery,"" said Dr Jadej.    "
122,122, Build a social safety net in the aftermath of COVID-19    Fri 21 August 2020  ," COVID-19 reveals the workers' vulnerability which experts call the Thai government to build a social safety net to strengthen their resilience to crises.   During the Board Relation and Empowering Community of Commitment and Accountability (BREC) online meeting on 17 Aug, Somchai Jitsuchon, research director for inclusive development at Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI), raised concerns for millions of Thai workers who had been hardest hit by the pandemic.   The BREC meeting is an annual event that the National Health Security Office (NHSO), the government agency running Universal Health Coverage, brings in experts from multi fields to discuss health solutions and social issues.   Thailand has succeeded in controlling the spread of the coronavirus, with around 3,300 confirmed cases and 58 deaths despite having nearly 70 million populations.   But the Thai government's measures to curb the outbreak, including social distancing and city lockdowns, has forced businesses to shut down and lay off many workers.    Somchai said that an estimation of five million people had lost jobs in Apr. It's expected that the other four million would have the same fate by the end of this year. Meanwhile, household debt is rising.   The outbreak has also revealed inequality in Thai society, in which low-income workers tend to lose jobs. Their incomes are more likely to slash by employers. Some people found difficulties in adapting to social distancing, including students from poor-family backgrounds who can't afford devices for joining online classes.   Thai government provided 5,000-baht monthly subsidies to assist millions of people affected by the coronavirus. However, said Somchai, many people can't reach the aids.       ""How can we develop long-term policies that can prevent people from missing out the aids and opportunities?"" he said. ""We should consider universal welfare in the aftermath of COVID-19, so there will be no one left behind.""   Woothisarn Tanchai, secretary-general of King Prajadhipok's Institute, said during the meeting that a social safety net would enhance Thai people's capacity to cope with crises.     He gave an example of the NHSO's Community Health Fund (CHF), which becomes a social safety net for local communities during the outbreak.    CHF provides the fund to local communities and local administrative organizations who are interested in launching health promotion and disease prevention projects in their areas.   Some communities used the fund to purchase masks and alcohol gel and hand them to local residents, or hired care workers to assist elderly persons who were forced to stay home.   ""The CHF proves that a social safety net can help local communities get through the outbreak,"" said Woothisarn.   ""It also shows that area-based management [of a social safety net] could be a solution for Thailand. Some areas where members of local communities work together have zero cases of the coronavirus. Their collaboration absorbed shocks and relieve both health and economic impact on local residents.""    Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said that the Thai government had invested in universal healthcare coverage that could cope with the ongoing health crisis.     He added that the Public Health Ministry had prepared the 100-million-USD fund to support foreign research institutes that are developing the COVID-19 vaccine.   ""This fund will give Thailand an opportunity to access the vaccine when it was successfully developed. Thailand must participate in the global effort for vaccine development so we won't miss the train,"" he said.   "
123,123, NHSO acts to assure care access during COVID-19 outbreak    Mon 17 August 2020  ,"  National Health Security Office (NHSO), the Thai government agency operating Universal Health Coverage (UCS) scheme, announced its achievement through 1.8-billion-baht health initiatives during the COVID-19 outbreak.   The NHSO has partnered with health providers and community pharmacist network in running the new health services that adapt to social distancing, maintain people's access to healthcare, and reduce overcrowding at hospitals. Those initiatives are;   Free COVID-19 testing  Every Thai citizen can get free COVID-19 testing if he/she has a record of exposure to the disease. More than 401,946 tests were conducted between 2 Mar and 20 July. Half of the tests were provided to beneficiaries of Social Security Scheme, 34% UCS, and 12% Civil Servants Medical Benefits scheme. The NHSO reimbursed around 1.2 billion baht to laboratory and hospital operators that conduct the tests. Currently, 190 laboratories in Thailand are certified for COVID-19 testing. Out of those, 132 and 58 are run by state-own and private facilities, respectively.   Free COVID-19 treatment  Every Thai citizen and foreigner living in Thailand can get free COVID-19 treatment if he/she is infected. As of 20 Jul, free treatment was provided to 25,953 patients. The NHSO reimbursed more than 524 million baht to health providers that had offered the treatment---covering free medicines, patients' meals, negative-pressure room services, the operation of COVID-19 special wards, purchase of Personal Protective Equipment, vehicles used for patient transfers and health facility cleaning.    Medicine home delivery  Under the context of social distancing, health providers have shipped medicines to patients' addresses so they could stay home and avoid contracting to the coronavirus. Chronic-disease patients in stable conditions---including those with hypertension, diabetes, and HIV---are encouraged to register for medicine home delivery service. The NHSO has covered postage fees for health providers with an amount of 50 baht per shipment. More than 121,119 parcels filled with medicine are shipped to patients' homes between 8 Apr and 22 Jul. More than 200 hospitals have provided the service.   Pick up medicine from the community pharmacies  Patients can pick up medicine from community pharmacies nearby their homes since Oct 2019, which is the effort of the NHSO and pharmacist network to reduce overcrowding at hospitals and save time for patients. The initiative has become more significant during the COVID-19 outbreak, in which patients found difficulty in commuting to hospitals. Under the normal process, UCS beneficiaries must visit hospitals where they register with, get prescriptions from doctors, then get medicine from the pharmaceutical dispense unit. It can take at least half a day to complete a hospital visit.   To shorten the time spending at hospitals, patients can visit community pharmacies and pick up medicine according to doctors' prescriptions. The NHSO will then reimburse the cost of medicine to pharmacy operators, approximately around 33,000 bath per pharmacy per year, or 70 baht per prescription. As of 15 Jul, the NHSO reimbursed about 39 million baht in total to pharmacy operators and health providers who supply medicine in this initiative. Over 130 hospitals and 1,199 pharmacies join the program,   After-hour urgent care service  Patients can request urgent care from health providers during after hours, which is the Public Health Ministry's policy to increase people's access to quality care and reduce overcrowding at the emergency rooms. More than 63,692 people used the after-hour urgent care service between 1 Dec 2019 and 20 Jul. The NHSO funded nearly 12 million baht to hospital providers that run the service.  "
124,124, Home care services for vulnerable people   Mon 10 August 2020  ," Vulnerable people including bedridden elderly persons, people living with disabilities and chronic diseases can access home care services provided under the Long-Term Care (LTC)---a community-based program covered by the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS).   Dr Rattaphon Triamwichanon, Assistance Secretary-General of National Health Security Office (NHSO), said that the LTC program was a social innovation that aimed to improve healthcare access for vulnerable people, especially the dependent elderly persons in remote areas. The program relies on the networks of village health volunteers, many of whom are recruited and trained for becoming ""caregivers.""   ""Village health volunteers have played an important role in coping the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Dr Rattaphon. ""They are a result of the public health movement that has empowered local communities for more than a decade.""   The LTC program involves caregivers who provide home care services and to bedridden and dependent elderly persons, people living with disabilities and chronic diseases.     It is financed by the NHSO, which oversees the UCS, and local administrative organizations that co-fund activities relevant to the program's target groups. The NHSO distributes the fund equivalent to 6,000 baht per head per year.   Pong Yaeng, a hilly subdistrict 28 kilometers away from Chiang Mai city, is one of the piloted areas for the LTC program.    With more than 8,800 populations, Pong Yaeng hosts at least 65 bedridden elderly persons, 26 people living with disabilities, and more than 800 people with chronic diseases including cancer, and kidney failure.   Wan Muang-na, President of Pong Yang Sub-district Administrative Organization, said that his team had operated a care center for elderly persons and dependent people, which were financially supported by the LTC program.   The program's fund was used to hire ambulance and vehicle drivers to take older people to hospitals in the city, also, give a ride to caregivers who have regularly visited remote communities.   Currently, 45 bedridden seniors are looked after by the caregivers. More than 200 village health volunteers have stationed in Pong Yaeng, 11 of which passed the caregiver training. One becomes a care manager, the head of the caregiver team.    Boonseub Srichaiwong, director of Pong Yaeng Nai community hospital, said that his staff had partnered with Pong Yang sub-district administrative organization in operating activities under the LTC program.   The hospital staff has worked with caregivers to asset the health conditions of local residents, and decide a ""care plan"" that includes the management of medicine home delivery and telemedicine services.

125,125, NHSO promotes local health projects for promoting good health   Thu 06 August 2020  ," Thai local communities and organizations are encouraged to submit health-relating project proposals to the National Health Security Office (NHSO), in promoting good health and closing health service gap in the post-COVID-19.   The projects will be financially supported by the Community Health Fund (CHF), a scheme managing by the NHSO that aims to empower local communities and engage them in health decision-making.   “We're inviting both local communities and organizations to submit project proposals to our committee,” said Jakkrit Ngowsiri, the NHSO deputy secretary-general.   “It’s proved during the COVID-19 outbreak that they have played a big role in preventing the spread of the disease. Their ideas through the proposals will be valuable.”   Wutthichai Wong-in, President of Phikun Ok Subdistrict Administrative Organization in Nakhon Nayok, said that the CHIF had provided the means for fighting the coronavirus, allowing his community to purchase and distribute masks, alcohol gel, thermometer, and food to residents.  His community also used the CHF fund for running an elderly care project. Around 22.6% of the local populations are senior citizens, he said, the CHF gives his chance to start an initiative that fits a regional demographic trend.   “We’ll keep supporting the projects that promote healthcare access in the post COVID-19,” said Veerachai Konmanee, director of the NHSO’s community health support unit.    “One of our highlighted projects will be home care for patients with non-communicable diseases, so they don’t need to visit hospitals and expose to the coronavirus.”   The NHSO will also accept the proposals that enhance the capacity of village health volunteers, who could be trained to provide home-based care or deliver medicines from hospitals to patients’ homes. The proposals may include children and elderly, the vulnerable population groups focused by the NHSO---such as screening coronavirus for students, improving children’s nutrition and access to vaccination, and educating elderly about health issues.     “These are just some of the examples that we want to see in the proposals. But local communities and organizations can come up with other ideas too. We’re opening to every new possibility.”   "
126,126, Antidotes from Thai National Antidote Project provided to Malaysia emergency case   Thu 30 July 2020  ,"          Thailand shipped antidotes to Malaysia to save the life of a worker poisoned by heavy metal---a mission under the Thai national antidote program that secures patients' access to orphan drugs.   Dr Satariya Trakulsrichai from Ramathibodi Poison Center, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital of Mahidol University, said that a physician team in Malaysia had contacted her unit on 17 July.   They reported a case of a worker poisoned by nickel while working in a chromium factory of Malacca city. He required 40 vials of calcium disodium versenate (CaNa2EDTA), a chelating agent that is used for treating severe heavy metal poisoning. It's an orphan drug that produced and imported by very few pharmaceutical companies.   Learning about the case, said Dr Satariya, the staff of Ramathibodi Poison Center discussed with the National Health Security Office (NHSO) and the Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO) about the medical stockpile and shipping method. The drug was eventually reached Malaysia on 20 July.   Ramathibodi Poison Center is one of the organizations that join the Thai National Antidote Project (TNAP), set up in 2010 to secure necessary antidotes and antivenoms and allow patients to access them appropriately and timely.   Partners of the project include the NHSO which has provided financial and technical support, and the GPO which procures orphan drugs according to the list of TNAP.   TNAP is a result of a lesson learned from the 2006 incident in Nan, a province in northern Thailand, where more than a hundred people became severely sick after eating bamboo shoots contaminated by clostridium botulinum bacteria.    At least 40 people must use ventilators because the disease caused breathing problems.   To cure them, the Public Health Ministry took six days to seek antidotes from international pharmaceutical companies. The incident prompted government agencies to develop TNAP to prevent a shortage of orphan drugs.   The success of TNAP was recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO), which encouraged Thailand to expand the project to a regional level under iCAPS program, or Initiation for Coordinated Antidotes Procurement in Southeast Asia. Thailand has shipped antidotes to its partner countries since then.   In 2018, Thailand sent botulinum antitoxin to threat three patients in Nigeria. One died, unfortunately. Two were in an intensive care unit when WHO representative in Nigeria notified Thailand about the case.   ""TNAP reflects the capacity of Thailand in procuring and securing orphan drugs for both domestic and international patients,"" said Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul.   ""Shipping medicines to our partner countries is an important mission.

The move is seen as the NHSO’s further step to extend the scheme’s coverage and guarantee patients' access to a full range of healthcare services.        Sakchai Kanjanawatana, Secretary-General of National Health Security Office (NHSO), the Thai government's agency operating UCS, said that the expanding coverage aimed to provide new services needed by patients.   Among the new service items are;    - Treatment for hemophilia  - Free MMR vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella for children age 1.5 years  - Screening test for Down's syndrome, provided to every pregnant woman  - Fecal immunochemical test for colorectal cancer  - Acupuncture and electroacupuncture for patients with stroke  Dr Sakchai said that NHSO would also expand UCS coverage to health services adjusted to fit social distancing and post-COVID-19 context. Those services include;     - Dispatching medicines from hospitals to pharmacies in local communities. Patients can pick up medicines at pharmacies without traveling to hospitals.   - Delivering medicines and medical supplies from hospitals to patients' homes.  - Providing consultant to pregnant women and patients require physical therapy at home.   - Telemedicine   - Home chemotherapy   In addition, the NHSO will remain UCS benefit packages for patients who require high-cost treatment including;  - Provide antiretroviral drugs to HIV patients.  - Distribute orphan drug to patients with rare diseases.  - Provide tuberculosis vaccines, recombinant erythropoietin drugs, abortion pills and guiding catheter to patients  - Distribute dialysate and catheter for patients who require continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.

128,128, Thai UHC and COVID-19: Leaving no one behind   Thu 30 July 2020  ,"          Foreigners, including migrant workers living in Thailand, can get free COVID-19 testing and treatment as part of the Thai government's attempt to curve the pandemic.      ""It's impossible to split the health services given to Thai citizens and foreigners when fighting the pandemic,"" said Dr Jadej Thammatacharee, deputy secretary-general of National Health Security Office, the government agency operating Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS), one of three healthcare schemes available in Thailand.   ""Because if the coronavirus infects foreigners, it can spread to the local populations too. We must adopt the concept of universal healthcare when handling with the pandemic. Everyone in our country must have access to health services regardless of their places of origin.""   Dr Jadej recently shared Thailand's experience in combatting Covid-19 in an online conference Migration and Health: Implication of COVID-19 and achieving Universal Health Coverage, hosted by Asian Development Bank and BIG Capacity Building Program in Manila, the Philippines, on 15 July.   As of 26 June, more than 603,650 samples were tested, with over 3,250 Covid-19 confirmed cases and 58 death.   During the conference, Dr Jadej said that the Thai government had focused on two measures.    First, the Thai government has mobilized fund to fight Covid-19 and provide free testing and treatment to foreigners living in Thailand. Thai citizens are covered by the government's healthcare schemes---UCS, Social security Scheme, and Civil Servant Medical benefits Scheme.     Testing is provided to the population at risk, especially people who have close contact with a patient with confirmed or probable Covid-19.    Second, health volunteers are encouraged to take part in fighting the pandemic. Health volunteers are local community members who trained by health staff to do specific tasks such as screening of diseases, visiting residents' houses, and reporting local health problems to the government's public health units.   They have played a big part in COVID-19 response by monitoring the local community members and migration flow, also, advocates for disease prevention.    ""Operating health volunteers do not cost much. Neither requires high technology. We need to assign them the clear tasks and engage them in the design of a disease prevention strategy that fit the local context,"" said Dr Jadej.    He added that the Thai government had highlighted disease prevention actions---by actively searching for suspected cases and put them in quarantines. This allows the Thai government to save the budget because the treatment for mild cases costs less than severe ones.  "

We will make sure that the NHSO has enough budget to take care of their health.""   According to Thai regulation, every Thai citizen becomes UCS beneficiaries since his/her birth. When one is formally hired by employers, his/her healthcare benefit will shift to SSS. On the other hand, if one loses jobs, his/her healthcare benefit will move back to UCS. One works with the government office will be provided free healthcare services under Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme.     This regulation, which facilitates Thailand's universal healthcare coverage, guarantees healthcare access to more than 99% of the population regardless of their employment statuses.   Dr. Karoon Kuntiranont, NHSO deputy secretary-general, has recently analyzed the population protected under each healthcare scheme.   He found that around 43,090 people slipped out of SSS during the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting the dire economic condition that forces many workers to lose jobs. Meanwhile, over 39,300 people became UCS beneficiaries in the same period.    The Office of the National Economic and Social Development Council estimates that Thailand's unemployment rate might reach 4% by the end this year, equivalent to Two million people, from less than 1% last year.

130,130, Healthcare rights of stateless people    Mon 13 July 2020  ," More than 520,000 stateless people are living in Thailand with no access to the government's healthcare schemes.     National Health Security Office (NHSO) 's data shows that most of the stateless population were born on Thai soil. But their parents did not register their birth with Thai authorities, or they may lose identity documents that result in their failure to obtain Thai citizenship.    According to Thai law, only Thai citizens can benefit the government's universal healthcare coverage comprising of three healthcare schemes---Universal Coverage Scheme, Social Security Scheme, and Civil Servant Medical Benefits Scheme.   Therefore, stateless people must pay medical fees from their own pockets. If they want to benefit Thai healthcare schemes, they need to request for Thai citizenship, which must go through years of the nationality verification process.   The tragedy of being an undocumented person, despite a child of Thai residents, is told by a story of Ice Waseng, a 66-year-old woman whose parents did not register her birth at a younger age.   Her daughter, Wilai Saetan, spent more than five years to collect documents and apply Thai citizenship for her. Thai authorities eventually provided her a Thai identity card in 2017. But her health condition had been deteriorated by stroke and cholecystitis. She died one year after her success in obtaining Thai citizenship.   ""The procedure for requesting a Thai identity card was tedious and complicated. When my mother was granted Thai citizenship, she could access free healthcare services under the Universal Coverage Scheme. But it was too late. She was severely ill,"" said Wilai.   Supreeda Adulyanon, the manager of the Thai Health Promotion Foundation (ThaiHealth), said that his organization had tracked the venerable populations in urban areas and found many were stateless persons with chronic diseases.   Thai government has tried to solve this problem. In 2010, the cabinet approved the Public Health Ministry's launching of ""the healthcare for stateless people fund"" that would cover medical fees for stateless people.   But it does not promise healthcare rights to them. Some health providers have denied free healthcare services for non-Thai citizens.     On 8 July, Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul led nine governmental and non-governmental organizations to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in an attempt to deliver free healthcare services to stateless people.   ""Though universal healthcare coverage is available in Thailand, there are many Thai people without identity cards who can't benefit from the government's healthcare schemes,"" he said.   ""We expect that our collaboration will progress an establishment of healthcare rights for everyone born in Thailand. We must close the health equity gap.""   The organizations signed the MoU include Interiors Ministry, Justice Ministry, Public Health Ministry, Social Development and Human Security Ministry, Bangkok Metropolitan Administrator, ThaiHealth, Pan International Thailand, Human Settlement Foundation and the NHSO.   They will work together on speeding up the national verification process and providing assistance to stateless people.

131,131, UHC: Thailand's key to COVID-19 fighting   Sat 11 July 2020  ,"  Universal Healthcare Coverage (UHC) plays a vital role in fighting against Covid-19 in Thailand.        ""We have learned that UHC contributes to the strengthening of our health system, making it more resilient and more responsive. UHC is also a key to enhance global health security,"" said Dr. Sakchai Kanjanawatana, secretary-general of the National Health Security Office (NHSO),   He spoke in a Thursday online panel ""Investing in Health: The Key to Building Back Better from COVID-19 and Accelerating Progress for UHC and Sustainable Development"", which is a side event the United Nations High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. The panel was hosted by the World Health Organization in collaboration with the Group of Friends of UHC and Global Health, UHC2030.   ""Thailand's success stems from a combination of public health and social measures, including active surveillance and screening, state and local quarantines, effective communication strategies, enhanced social safety nets, and awareness-raising campaigns,"" he said.   ""UHC scheme rests on Three Principles---equity, efficiency, and participation.""   Equity means both Thai nationals and foreigners in Thailand can access COVID-19 related health services.    During the pandemic, UHC budget was allocated to cover the costs of testing, tracing, treatment, and additional compensation for health workers---making Thailand's health crisis response efficient.   Participation is essential to fight the pandemic, said Dr Sakchai.   Local communities have engaged in health emergency response through the Community Health Fund, which provides financial support to local communities' health promotion and prevention programs.   Parts of the fund was spent on procuring face masks and hand sanitizers, and supporting village health volunteers who are trained to look after the health conditions of local communities.  Village health volunteers have played a crucial role in fighting the pandemic by monitoring people's movement, conducting house visits and check-ups, disseminating information, and reporting to the public health authorities.   Dr Sakchai said that the pandemic had created the ""new normal"" that urges public health sector to improve UHC.   The necessity of social distancing magnifies the potential of telemedicine. Currently, only 1% of state hospitals run telemedicine services, prompting NHSO to expand the services to 5% by next year.   During the city lockdowns, NHSO initiated service delivery such as sending medicines out by post and allowing patients to pick up their medicines at local pharmacies.   ""It doesn't have to take COVID-19 for us to realize the importance of UHC in advancing the global health agenda and in realizing the Sustainable Development Goals,"" said Dr Sakchai.    ""We can learn from each other so we can do better. Together, with commitment and determination, UHC can become a reality for all.""  ………………………..10 July 2020     "
132,132, UCS saves a girl from thalassemia   Wed 08 July 2020  ,"   A seven-year-old girl received a stem cell transplant under the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS).   When Sasiwimon Ponlap was pregnant seven years ago, a doctor at Ramathibodi Hospital found out that her child had a high risk of having thalassemia.   The warning became true. When her daughter, Jintanakarn “Jean” Boonklomjit, reached the age of one, the symptoms of anemia began to show off. She had been under treatment since then.   “She needed a regular blood transfusion and folic acid to help red blood cells develop. It costed our family around 17,000 baht a month,” said Sasiwimon.   Later the doctor suggested Jean get a bone marrow transplant, also called a stem cell transplant---a procedure to replace bone marrow that has been damaged by disease and give rise to new blood cells. Jean would need stem cells from a donor.    It was about the same that Sasiwimon gave birth to her second child, Sila “Jio” Boonklomjit. The lab test found Jio’s cells matched Jean’s perfectly.   But the cost of the transplant could reach over 1.5 million baht and cause Sasiwimon’s family a financial burden.    One day, coincidentally, she scrolled through social media and saw the information of UCS benefits package with a stem cell transplant being included.   Having a glimpse of hope, she contacted UCS operator National Health Security Office. She was told that Jean could apply for a stem cell transplant as every child in Thailand becomes UCS beneficiaries since their birth.   NHSO agreed to reimburse the transplant and other medical fees for Jeans while she was treated at Ramathibodi Hospital.   In April, Jean received a stem cell transplant successfully.   “I admit that before I did not see the value of UCS. Because I didn’t have any ailment,” said Sasiwimon.   “But after going through everything with my daughter, I’ve learned that UCS is the healthcare rights that everyone can truly access and benefit from.”   Jean has currently visited the hospital weekly for a medical check-up.    During the peak of the Covid-19 outbreak, Sasiwimon and Jio were infected by the coronavirus. They both received free treatment under UCS, while Jean got a free test. Fortunately, she does not get the disease.   She can focus on her recovery and expect a longer life.       "

""We've introduced online registration in recent years to help healthcare unit operators planning for vaccination services,"" said Dr. Karoon   The registration can be done on Line application or NHSO website.    Bhumibol Adulyadej Hospital in Bangkok's Sai Mai district is one of the NHSO partners that provide vaccination services for UCS.   Dr. Nop Tujinda, the hospital's deputy director, said that more than 24,000 people had registered for flu shots at his hospital.   ""Before having an online registration system, we couldn't estimate the number of people arriving at the hospital for flu shots each day. Now we can prepare enough vaccines and improve the patient flow,"" said Dr. Nop.   ""Applying online technology in our services is a good step to advance healthcare system."" Seventy-two-year-old Thitiwach Taweepongsapat, a patient with heart disease, registered for a flu shot a week before visiting the hospital.   ""I prefer the registration system. I could make sure that I would get the vaccine on my visiting day at the hospital,"" he said.   ""I was directed to the vaccination area after showing my registration certificate to the hospital staff.

134,134, Home-based chemotherapy added to the UCS benefits package.    Fri 26 June 2020  ,"   Home-based chemotherapy for colon cancer will be introduced in the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS)’s benefits package, as part of an effort to adopt social distancing in healthcare services.   “Though the outbreak has been under control in Thailand, there’s the concern for the second wave of coronavirus,” said Dr. Sakchai Kanjanawatana, Secretary-General of National Health Security Office (NHSO), the government agency operating UCS.   “Therefore, healthcare services and UCS benefits package must be adapted for social distancing.”   The NHSO plans to pilot home-based chemotherapy for colon cancer patients in 27 public hospitals by the end of this year, allowing UCS beneficiaries to access treatment without visiting hospitals while avoiding the risk of exposure to the coronavirus.     Dr. Sakchai is confident that home-base chemotherapy will be practical and cost-saving as Ramathibodi Hospital, a university hospital capable of super tertiary care, achieved a similar initiative since 2016.      Previously, the NHSO introduced other initiatives such as telemedicine and medicine home delivery service to encourage patients to stay home.     The availability of the UCS budget creates a possibility to add new items to the scheme’s benefits package and guarantees the patients’ access to healthcare services in the most challenging time of the pandemic crisis, said Dr. Sakchai.      "
135,135, NHSO engages disabled people in improving UCS benefits package    Sat 20 June 2020  ," National Health Security Office (NHSO) held an annual public hearing for people with disabilities as parts of its commitment to engage multi-stakeholders in improving benefits package of Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS)   The public hearing was held via Facebook live on 10 June, adjusting to social distancing measures during the Covid-19 pandemic.   ""2.7 million people with disabilities have registered in the UCS and get benefits package including free assistive devices and physical therapy,"" said Weerachai Konmanee, Director of the NHSO's community health services unit, during the hearing.   ""The NHSO has always recognized their voices. We've considered them a part of our effort to improve benefits package and expand health service coverage.""   When the UCS was introduced in 2002, the National Health Security Act set a legal framework for the NHSO to ""encourage the process of participation"" of health providers, purchasers, and local government organizations.   Having participation is proved to be an effective mechanism that drives the NHSO to develop new benefits package and expand the coverage of existing benefits. For example, the engagement of patients with AIDS/HIV and kidney failure led the NHSO to introduce free antiretroviral drugs and dialysis into the UCS benefits package in the late 2000s.     During the recent hearing, representatives of people with disabilities, health providers and local government organization expressed their ideas and raised the challenges of disabled care.     Montian Boontan, senator and the former president of Thailand Association of the Blind, said that Thailand needed more research and development (R&D) on assistive devices and medicines for disabled people. ""The NHSO should encourage more R&D that helps disabled people access a better quality of care,"" he said.   ""Some medicines offered in the UCS benefits package are not always good in quality. If disabled people want better ones, they need to pay extra. Therefore, disabled people with low income can't access good medicines.""   The hearing resonated the need for the NHSO to engage local government organizations into disabled care. In the past years, the NHSO has distributed UCS budget to local government organizations' projects for enhancing the life quality of vulnerable populations.     Sujin Boonmalert, Deputy Permanent-Secretary of Saraburi Provincial Administrative Organization, said that the NHSO had co-funded many projects with his organization including installing ramps in public buildings, sign languages training, and wheelchairs fixing for disabled people.   His organization plans to establish disabled care center in every sub-district, with the financial support from the NHSO.       ""We will take all opinions to our considerations. We want to increase the level of vulnerable groups' participation, which will help us improve the UCS,"" said Dr Jetsada Chokdamrongsuk, Chair of the hearing and the NHSO board member.       "
136,136," NHSO seeks ""monk health volunteers"" to promote primary care in temples.    Fri 19 June 2020  ","   National Health Security Office (NHSO) and Phetchaburi Administrative Organization piloted a training program for ""monk health volunteers,"" who will lead primary care and look after the health conditions of monks in temples.     The program is called ""Phra Kilanupattha"" and developed by the Department of Health, which aims to enhance health knowledge of selected monks from each temple.   Dr. Prachaksvich Lebnak, NHSO Deputy Secretary-General, said that the training program combined Buddhism approach and modern medical know-how in promoting the good health of the monks.   Buddhism upholds the value of well-being as necessary for a meaningful and productive life, and encourage people to handle human vulnerability to pain and suffering.   ""Monks have experienced health problems, just like most people. Non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and lung diseases are common among monks,"" said Dr. Prachaksvich.     ""We expect that monks joining the training program will have a better understanding of health promotion and disease prevention. They can look after one another in the temples.""   Because of duties at the temples, monks often visit hospitals when their health is in a severe stage. Some senior monks do not see doctors when they are sick because of the temples' distances to hospitals.   Monks also face health risk factors, especially from offering food. People often provide the best and tasty food to monks---meaning it may make from ingredients with too much sugar, high sodium, and cholesterol.    Thai Health Promotion Foundation, an autonomous government agency promoting good health, launched a survey on several monks in 2016, and found that consuming unhealthy food and doing less exercise had caused their health problems.   Phetchareuk Tansawad, Director of Phetchaburi Provincial Public Health Office, said that monks joining the training program had an opportunity to learn about health knowledge from practitioners at community-level hospitals.   After completing the program, participants will be able to provide primary care including blood pressure and temperature measurement and blood specimen collection.   Around 190 monks in Phetchaburi have joined the training to be completed in August. His health office targets to engage two monks from each temple. Two hundred seventy-five temples are located in Phetchaburi.   ""To have monk health volunteers will increase monks' ability to care for themselves and avoid health risk factors in daily routines,"" he said.   During the program, NHSO in collaboration with Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives and National Science and Technology Development Agency provides health monitoring devices to temples.   These devices can link health status record to smartphones, allowing monks to report health information to physicians.    "
137,137, UCS gives free COVID-19 testing to every Thai citizen   Wed 17 June 2020  ,"   Thai Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) provides free COVID-19 testing to every Thai citizen, regardless of their registered healthcare schemes.     Dr. Sakchai Kanjanawatana, Secretary-General of National Health Security Office (NHSO) operating UCS, said that conducting extensive testing was an essential measure that could control the spread of the coronavirus effectively.   Since the outbreak disrupted Thailand early this year, NHSO placed free COVID-19 testing in UCS benefit package immediately and extend its coverage to beneficiaries of other healthcare schemes such as Social Security Scheme and Civil Servant Healthcare Benefits.   ""Free COVID-19 testing for everyone is the most important healthcare benefit during the pandemic. It aims to find infectious cases and get them into treatment as soon as possible so we can contain the virus quickly,"" said Dr. Sakchai.        Between 2 Mar and 22 May, Thailand has conducted 375,453 tests in total. Around 171,440 out of those were provided by the NHSO, equivalent to 418-million-baht budget covered by UCS.   Social Security Scheme beneficiaries received testing covered by the NHSO the most, accounting to 52.31% of the tests, follow by UHC 28.86% and Civil Servant Healthcare Benefits 14.88%. The rest of the tests was for people with other healthcare packages, including private health insurance.   One by three of the tests were conducted for people living in Bangkok, the hardest-hit province by the coronavirus.   As the outbreak is unlikely to end soon, the NHSO targets to provide 1.4 million tests by the end of this year, and other 3.25 million in next year.   NHSO also prepares a 1.32-billion-baht budget for providing COVID-19 vaccine to four million people when it becomes available. Currently, global pharmaceutical companies are developing the vaccine and making good progress.      "

NHSO covers the cost of the delivery service.     Currently, 111 hospital operators across Thailand have started sending parcels filled with drugs and medical supplies to non-COVID-19 patients. The other 398 hospital operators have shown their interests to do the same.   Up to date, 27,992 parcels have been sent from hospitals to patients, equivalent to 1.40 million baht of postage fees.    Around 25.46% are patients with hypertension, 17.28% diabetes, and 2.82% HIV. The rest are patients with non-urgent chronic diseases such as asthma, emphysema, glaucoma, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and epilepsy.   NHSO plans to extend the home delivery service to 30 Sep. However, with some positive feedbacks, NHSO will likely include the service in the UCS benefit package in the future.    Korkij Danchaivichit, Thailand Post president, said that the company would like to continue the medicine home delivery service, with a possibility to expand the target groups to patients registered with other healthcare schemes beyond UCS.   ""This is a new service and innovation, that will improve our healthcare system.

139,139, NHSO to request the government’s extra budget to tackle COVID-19   Fri 05 June 2020  ,"          National Health Security Office (NHSO) will request 15.97-billion-baht budget from the government's 1.9-trillion-baht COVID-19 stimulus package to improve healthcare access for Universal Healthcare Coverage (UHC) 's 49 million beneficiaries.  Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said that the requesting budget would cover both Covid-19 and non-COVID-19 healthcare services from this year until 2021.   Social distancing will last for months to years, he said. There' s the possibility for the second wave of the outbreak. NHSO, in partnership with the government and Public Health Ministry, needs to mobilize health financing for emergency response and recovery.      Around 11.47 billion baht of the requesting budget will go to fund COVID-19 care including screening test, suspected cases monitoring, field hospitals, vaccine (if available), health promotion and prevention programs, and patient transfer.   Another 4.5 billion baht will be directed to non-COVID-19 care including telehealth/telemedicine pilot projects in state hospitals, postal delivery of drugs and medical supplies to patients' homes, and the distribution of medicines through pharmacies in patients' community area.    The budget will also cover the NHSO's providing of seasonal influenza shots to 2.36 million people, in addition to 4.16 million people getting free shots currently.     It will fund mobile lab services with 941,000 testing capacity, allowing patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension to get medical checkups without exposure to the coronavirus when visiting hospitals.     Dr. Sakchai Kanjanawatana, NHSO Secretary-General, said that the NHSO had concerned the wellbeing and livelihood of the health workers and volunteers.    NHSO will request another 148 million baht from the government's stimulus package to provide compensation to health workers in case of illness, disability or death that is related to performing work duties during the pandemic.    Moreover, many workers have lost jobs during the pandemic, expelling them from the Social Security Scheme that insures employers only.   According to Thailand's insurance system, jobless workers will be automatically transferred from the Social Security Scheme to the UHC scheme that guarantees healthcare access to vulnerable populations including unemployed persons and informal workers.     It' s estimated that more than 990,000 workers will become the UHC beneficiaries in post-COVID-19. The NHSO will request 3.68 billion baht from the government's stimulus package to cover healthcare services for these workers.    ""NHSO will spend the requesting budget in worthwhile activities and services, with the best efficiency, for the best of UHC beneficiaries,"" said Dr. Sakchai.

140,140, Private sector essential to achieve UHC   Wed 29 January 2020  ," Private sector essential to achieve UHC    28 Jan 2020—Private health providers play a big role in achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC). But the private sector needs good governance to assure transparency and its delivery of health equity, said health experts at Prince Mahidol Award Conference on Monday.        Spoke during a sideline meeting titled “the role of private sector in accelerating progress toward UHC”, David Clarke, a team leader of UHC and Health System Law at the World Health Organization (WHO), said that it was important to engage private sector in healthcare system especially when the demand for UHC is increasing and requiring resources and better quality services.   According to WHO’s study in 65 countries, private provision represents 40% of all care---which is considered very significant.     “If we don’t engage private sector, we will miss an opportunity to improve healthcare quality and access to health equity,” he said. “But we need a new way of doing governance to engage private sector in health system.”   The governance requires collective actions from both private and public health providers in realizing UHC and create alliances or partnerships in healthcare delivery.  However, this has remained challenging as the private sector itself is very fragmented and difficult to govern in many countries.   Japan has engaged private sector in providing services to its National Health Insurance with a strong regulatory bodies and laws.   For example, Japanese law prohibits medical cooperation to use their profit on extending business beyond health sector. Dividend distribution to the corporation's funders is prohibited to assure that healthcare services are not turned into commodities, said Shinichiro Noda, Japan's Bureau of International Health Cooperation.   The Japanese government also sets up a committee to inspect health facilities and prices to prevent patients from getting low-quality care and being overcharged.      On the other hands, Philippines’ private sector regulation is not as strong as Japan. But PhiHealth, the country’s national health insurance system, must purchase health services from both public and private providers as the latter accounts for 65% of all hospitals in the country.   There is the risk of a higher cost of regulatory for the government and treatments for patients, said Dr Mary Jane Paez from the Department of Health of Philippines.   Waraporn Suwanwela, Director of Bureau of Policy and Strategy Development at National Health Security Office (NHSO), Thai government's independent organization overseeing UHC, said that NHSO had engaged private sector in UHC operation by putting private hospital representatives in its governance board.    Only 5% of health providers under UHC system were private.  Low participation of private sector has many reasons. One of those is expensive medical fee that unaffordable for Thai government, indicating that private sector in Thailand is not properly regulated when comes to an issue of pricing.   South Africa displays a contrasting picture. Private sector plays a big role in its healthcare services that remains a large gap between the rich and poor.   Mark Blecher, Chief Director of Health and Social Development of South Africa’s National Treasur, said that his government had little control on private sector.   Private health providers employed the majority of skilled medical staff, an equivalence of 69% of healthcare staff in the country. But they only serve out of pocket payment and 17% of insured persons especially the rich. About 42 % of insured persons use private insurance, which is not affordable by the majority.    “Pricing is important for access, and it’s not easy for us to solve,” said Blecher, adding that South Africa needs to find a strategy to deal with high private sector pricing and reform reimbursement system to allow the government to fund UHC in the future. /end    ///////////29 January 2020    "
141,141, Two Giants show the recent success of UHC as it reaches more millions of patients.   Wed 29 January 2020  ," Two Giants show the recent success of UHC as it reaches more millions of patients.    28 Jan 2020 – India and Indonesia said they are on the process of reducing inequity in the healthcare system by implementing (Universal Health Coverage) to their population. However, some challenges remain, such as benefits and lack of healthcare facilities.   Dr.Indu Bhushan, Chief Executive Officer of National Health Authority India, said after 16 months of Universal Health Coverage or PM-JAY policy, more than 540 million Indian people could access the healthcare service in 23 states out of 37 states. Nevertheless, 21,000 hospitals are cooperating with this scheme which 46% are the private hospitals. This is a good sign for India to keep moving forward with the UHC to cover all the population in nearly future.   Bhushan also said the strength of India's UHC is the robust IT system, after a year and a half, India already developed a platform such as more than 4.9 million calls are made to the Call Centre and more than 17.2 million visits the website. Furthermore, India also set up a Cloud system for gathering health information together, which makes it convenient for the system and the patience to access their health data.   ""India government also Invest in the audit system to 'analyse' the treatment data Service with Fraud Detection, including use of algorithms to improve the scheme frequently, ""said the director of the Indian National Health Office.   Nevertheless, the challenges remain. For example, the perception toward the PMJAY policy still low, or India still has various types of health coverage, such as the welfare for Civil Servants or the insurance for construction workers, which made the government difficult to organized and harmonized the scheme.    Tubagas Acdmad Choesni, Chair of National Social Security Council Indonesia, said Indonesia introduced Universal Health Coverage under the name Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional or JKN since 2014 with three fundamentals such as the budget need to be sustainability, must be equal in service. And have a goal of ""Single Purchaser"" in the end.   However, in 2020, there are still about 15% of the Indonesian population who do not yet cover by the JKN system. Another task is to deal with health prevention and promotion, which still not enough.   ""Another challenge is that the primary care system still cannot perform the primary healthcare procedure such as health screening Procurement of essential medicines, causing the patients to be concentrated only in a large hospital in the urban area. Indonesia is seeking for ways to add more primary systems that patience could reach easily, ""Tubakus said.   Dr.Suwit Wibulpolprasert, Senior Advisor of International Health Policy Program (IHPP), Thailand, expressed that he appreciates the progress of both countries. However, there is a vital precaution: a ""good governance"" system must be built so the system can be transparent – auditable.   ""The example from Thailand Before the UHC system started in 2001, shows that many poor people did not receive a health card that mainly provided for the poor. Only the villager who was close to the community leaders received that welfare, which is why we offered the UHC 20 years ago, we gave the welfare to every Thai citizen equally.   Dr.Suwit also recommends that both countries need to provide the ""Participatory System"" in the decision – making structure which makes the UHC more sustain, and also included the ""Provider"" or the Hospital as a 'Friend,' not completely doing Purchaser – Provider split as recommend in the World Bank's guideline because, in the end, both parties still need to work and make a decision on a particular issues together.    Dr.Kheya Melo Furtado, Assistant Professor from Goa Institute of Management, India, added that What the Indian government has to do is accelerate the audit process directly to the scheme and checking accounts to prevent ""leaks"" of the budget in the system. Therefore, the country needs to focus on supervision, especially at a small level, which is the necessary parts of the UHC.   ////////////////29 January 2020      "
142,142, Ramathibodi Poison Center’s role as a great pillar in the fight against poisons   Tue 28 January 2020  ," Ramathibodi Poison Center’s role as a great pillar in the fight against poisons  As chemicals are everywhere around us, we all can fall prey to many kinds of poison. Globally, poison incidents exceed the number of professionals who can provide proper help. Fortunately, Thailand has “Ramathibodi Poison Center” to tackle this serious problem. Established in 1996 under the Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, the centre started small with only a few staff members who worked 24/7, recounted Dr. Winai Wananukul, Director of Ramathibodi Poison Center. In its early days, the centre faced several difficulties, including the high cost of toxicology databases and regional database creation with indigenous venomous animals. One of the biggest challenges was antidote and antivenom drug administration since the formulas are not used as often, are often rare, and are often expensive, making them sometimes unobtainable at critical times. In 2005, the National Health Security Office (NHSO) came to financially support the centre to become a one-stop-service call centre for the public. Later, in 2010, it collaborated with the centre to better administer antidotes and antivenoms in a systematic way with the help of external partners, including the Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH). Together, they successfully worked on antidote supply, distribution and storage. Some antidotes can be produced by Thai Red Cross whereas others are imported by GPO. Antidotes can be stocked at any hospital-level depend on the characteristic of antidote and epidemiological techniques. Besides effective drug administration there are an innovative GIS system that locates the nearest antidotes and knowledge sharing sessions on toxicology for doctors, nurses, and pharmacists nationwide. Moreover, the budget for antidote acquisition is reduced while the coverage is expanding more. With over 23 years of success and round-the-clock operation, Ramathibodi Poison Center has proven itself to be one of the most trusted institutes among hospitals around the country and is known for its excellent care of every patient, from step one through to treatment completion. The centre currently  and toxicology. Plus five full-time and 18 part-time scientists who take calls and answer questions on poison. Each year, the centre treats over 25,000 cases. This considerable success has led to Ramathibodi Poison Center being recognised as an international hub that sends antidotes to other countries in cases of emergency. Dr. Winai spoke of future challenges. The centre needs to figure out how to sustainably manage its operational cost of about 10 million baht each year with no income, he said. This is because the centre, like poison centres around the globe, does not charge patients for fear of limiting access to cures. In the long run, for the public’s good, the centre requires a public subsidy. Moreover, the country needs more toxicology experts and laboratories to ensure quality treatment. The centre aims to help local hospitals with better diagnosis and cures in order to reduce the number of transfers. As one of the seven centres of excellence of Ramathibodi Hospital, Ramathibodi Poison Center believes that the heart of toxicology is to save critical patients before it is too late. Thus the centre is determined to treat patients from all regions of the country regardless of their treatment rights, races, and pre-conditions.    "
143,143, APD eases the burden on kidney patients   Fri 23 June 2023  ,"  APD eases the burden on kidney patients   The introduction of automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) into the Universal Coverage Scheme relieves the burden of patients living with end-stage kidney disease.   The Nephrology Society of Thailand reports that around eight million people in the country are living with kidney disease, with approximately 80,000 of these are in the end stage, and this group of patients has increased yearly.   One in 25 people with obesity and hypertension can precipitate kidney disease — prompting the Ministry of Public Health and relevant health authorities to promote healthy diets.   On the other hand, the National Health Security Office (NHSO) has continued to upgrade health benefits under Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) to tackle the increasing prevalence of chronic kidney disease.   Recently, the NHSO introduced automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) into the scheme, which covers 47 million people in Thailand.   APD is a device that delivers and drains the dialysate automatically.   Patients can run the machine while sleeping, allowing them to rest fully at night.    It has been provided to patients with end-stage kidney disease as a home therapy option, reducing time and cost compared to hospital dialysis sessions.       Patients receiving APD said their quality of life is much improved, said the NHSO secretary-general Dr Jadej Thammatacharee.   They use APD once for between eight and ten hours a day, mostly while sleeping at night.   As they get good rest, they could be productive at work during the day.    To perform the therapy, hospital staff offer training to patients and their caretakers — who will be assisted once they are familiar with the machine.   Ease burden  Along with APD, the UCS covers all crucial treatments for end-stage kidney disease, such as hemodialysis and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (or home peritoneal dialysis) which are the common treatments among the patients.    Kidney transplant is also available for UCS beneficiaries. But only 600 patients can get this type of treatment each year as it relies on the availability of donated kidneys.   According to the NHSO record, the survival rates of patients undergoing hemodialysis and home peritoneal dialysis are not different — against the common perception that the first is more effective than the latter.   The method of APD is similar to continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. The only difference is the first uses an automated machine that performs the treatment once a day.   The latter requires the patients to perform it between three to four times a day.    With this low frequency of task performance, APD eases the burden of patients, caregivers, and healthcare staff — providing more time to focus on emergency patients.     Free APD for all   Dr Jadej said that the NHSO will continue to improving treatment access for kidney disease patients.    His team vision the treatment to be accessible based on patients preference and the doctors’ guidance.   Each type of treatment suits different contexts health conditions, behaviors, lifestyle, and patients’ surrounding environment.   For example, elderly patients with multiple chronic diseases should not be treated with hemodialysis because they may experience adverse effects, including irregular low blood pressure that threatens their life.    APD fits patients who can’t continue with peritoneal dialysis because of abdominal wall defection, reducing the treatment’s effectiveness.   “We also want to reduce the waiting time for getting all treatment,” said Dr Jadej.    “Patients should also get the necessary devices used in the treatment, like APD, whenever they need them.”   He added that free APD is currently available for UCS beneficiaries.   But patients covered by the other two government healthcare schemes — Social Security Scheme (SSS) and Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme (CSMBS) — must pay out of their pockets for purchasing or renting the machine.   The priority should be given to beneficiaries of the Social Security Scheme, which covers all formal employees in Thailand, he suggested.   If these workers have end-stage kidney disease, they need to perform either hemodialysis (which requires them to be at the hospital three times a week) or home peritoneal dialysis (which requires them to perform the treatment every four to six hours).   This forces them to leave their jobs if the employers are not allowed to be absent from work.   “Free APD should be provided to those who need it regardless of their healthcare schemes,” said Dr Jadej.              ////////          "
144,144, Access to timely treatments through ‘Cancer Everywhere’    Tue 13 June 2023  ,"  Access to timely treatments through ‘Cancer Everywhere’    ‘Cancer Everywhere’ improves patients' access to treatment and medication regardless of geography and socioeconomic status.   Patchar, a 54-year-old patient living with cervical cancer, is one of the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) beneficiaries who are treated under the “Cancer Everywhere” program.   Launched in January 2021, the program aims to enhance patients’ access to cancer treatment and medications regardless of their whereabouts.    They can request doctor appointments and therapies from any hospital partnering with the National Health Security Office (NHSO), which oversees the UCS.   Previously, all cancer patients could get the treatments only at the hospitals with their names registered.  If they want to switch hospitals, they must obtain the physicians’ approval for inter-hospital transfer.   This inconvenience bars many patients from accessing affordable care on time, especially those migrating outside their provinces.   They must wait for months to get inter-hospital transfer approval or spend time and money to travel to hospitals far from their places.    These challenges were eliminated in the case of Patchar.   Timely inter-hospital transfers   In early 2022, Patchar noticed the warning signs of cervical cancer.   She discovered unusual bloody discharge and felt pain in the pelvic region, prompting her to request a screening test from a private-run Mith Maitree Hospital in Pak Kred district, Nonthaburi Province.   Two weeks after the test, she was informed that she had cancer cells in her cervix.   The hospital staff transfered her to a more-advanced Phra Nang Gao Hospital, where she received another test that confirmed cervical cancer in the third stage.   She was given the choice to get chemotherapy at National Cancer Institute or Rajavithi Hospital in Bangkok, and she chose the first.   This series of inter-hospital transfers proceeded without Patchar asking for transfer documents from doctors.   She could get on-time treatment when the transfers were quick and required less paperwork.    The most cost incurred during the treatment was covered by the UCS. Patchar paid little — 10 baht per a single chemotherapy session, and 135 baht for a blood test or a kidney function test.   To date, she has received chemotherapy for six months and likely recover within this year.   Switch to the public health system   Around 140,000 new cancer patients emerge in Thailand each year. The most common types of cancer found among the Thai population are liver, gallbladder, lung, breast, colon, and cervical cancer    Dr Suphakorn Pitakkankul, a cancer therapist at National Cancer Institute, revealed that his health unit records over two million visits by new and existing cancer patients each year.   Since the launch of the Cancer Everywhere program, he observed the number of cancer patients covered by the UCS slightly increase.   This is obvious in Bangkok where many immigrants living with cancer must rely on private hospitals as they couldn’t return to the state-run hospitals they registered within their home provinces.   Cancer Everywhere seems to encourage them to shift to the public health system due to the new setting condition.   The program is initiated under the collaboration of the NHSO and the Ministry of Public Health which set up the strategies to prevent and control cancer.   The prevention measure is translated into many health programs, including the distribution of human papillomavirus vaccines (HPV) to students across the country.   The vaccine protects against the virus that causes the risk of cervical cancer.   The screening test for multi-types of cancers, including cervical and colon cancer, are included in the UCS benefits package.   These tests are funded by the scheme, meaning patients don’t need to pay for the services.   New health benefits   The NHSO secretary-general Dr Jadej Thammatacharee revealed that the NHSO is considering introducing high-cost targeted drug therapy into the UCS.    The therapy uses medicines directed at proteins in breast cancer cells and blocks their growth.   The drugs are given to patients with stage-four breast cancer — in which cancer cells have metastasized and spread to distant parts of the body, including the bones, lungs, and liver.    However, more studies are needed to assert the therapy’s cost-effectiveness when provided to patients free of charge.   Dr Jadej believes that bringing the therapy into this scheme is possible because the NHSO has implemented a system of drug price negotiation which can reduce the cost of the expensive drug significantly.   “Moreover, we have managed the UCS fund effectively and can save cost for spending on new health benefits,” he said.

145,146, Dental implants accessible at state hospital   Tue 09 May 2023  ,"   Mae Wong Hospital in Thailand’s central Nakhon Sawan province increases people’s access to dental implants, improving their quality of life without them having to pay for the service out of pockets.   The state-run Mae Wong Hospital, a community hospital with 30 beds, has performed over 200 dental implant surgeries around 120 patients in the past two years — more than the total number of hospital operations in the entire province.   The hospital director Dr Prawit Saikunakorn said that his staff is dedicated to enhancing the people’s quality of life , which is the main reason for the hospital's ability to provide dental implant services.  They started providing free  dental implant surgeries to local people in 2015 as part of the government health program to commemorate King Rama IX or King Bhumibol Adulyadej.  The program continues under the reign of his son, King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun.  Under the program, the Thai government funds the materials and equipment needed for creating artificial teeth and operating dental implant surgeries — through the Universal Cover Scheme (UCS) that ensures healthcare access, including dental services, to 47 million Thais.    Throughout the years of joining the program, Mae Wong Hospital staff has built up knowledge and expertise,increasing their capacity to operate surgeries for patients.   Dr Prawit said that the patients have spread the word about the quality of dental services at the hospital, attracting more patients to the dental department. Some government agencies have recognized the value of this work and offered support in many ways.  For example, the National Science and Technology Development Agency, provided the hospital with a three-dimensional dental scan that helps dentists locate the best areas for teeth placement and ensures the success of the treatment.   “Many patients avoid dental implants because they falsely believe that it is inconvenient and the surgery process is complicated. It's not true anymore with the expertise and available equipment today,” said Dr Prawit.     Highly beneficial to the patients  In November, the Thai government launched a health program to increase people’s access to dental implants to commemorate of the sixth-cycle birthday anniversary of King Rama X or King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, who will reach the age of 72 in 2024.   Maw Wong Hospital has operated dental implants for 50 people, with 100 operations in total since the program's initiation.  The program continues Thailand’s mission to enhance people’s oral health since the era of King Rama IX, who emphasized the importance of having healthy teeth and urged all relevant organizations to treat people with oral problems.  Under the program, National Health Securirty Office NHSO — which oversees the UCS — ensures the availability of government funds to support hospitals providing dental implants and procures the necessary items and equipment for operating surgeries.  Patients are not required to pay any bills to get the service.  “This program is highly beneficial for Thai people because it eliminates the financial burden of the patients, many of whom are low-income workers and unable to afford dental implants due to their high cost,” said Dr Prawit.  “In Mae Wong district, our patients are mainly farmers with meager incomes. They will not request dental services if they must pay the fees. As they are not charged due to the UCS, they can save money for other necessary causes.  Priority is given to the patients with full-moth missing teeth, as they struggle the most with daily life.    Dr Preeda Pratumma, Head of Mae Woing Hospital’s Dental Department, assured that the hospital’s dental implant service is safe and has positive long-term results.  Most of his patients’ lives are improved as they can eat normally after having select replacements, improving their nutrition intake. Many have better engaged in social life as they are confident to speak and smile with artificial teeth in their mouths.   Dental care as a basic right  “Access to oral care is the basic right that any individual deserves to have,” said Dr Thanawat Mahatchariyapong, a dentist at Mae Wong Hospital.  “As a dentist, I’m proud of my role that helps people improve their lives and live happier.”The benefit of the program is confirmed by patients receiving dental implants.  A senior citizen Samruay Thammunee, also the UCS beneficiary, suffered from missing teeth due to her age. She couldn’t chew food and enjoy her meal — resulting in deteriorated health due to low nutrient intake.   She visited a dentist at Mae Wong Hospital and went through a dental implant surgery without paying a single cent.  “Many people are not aware that they can get the surgery without paying the fees.  They avoid seeking treatment because they are afraid of the expensive costs,” said Samruay, who can now eat well.  Another patient Boonyuen Yodtonglang said that she was afraid of the surgery because she thought it would painful and time-consume. But she decided to have the surgery after being convinced by the doctor.   She said she feels thankful to the doctor at Mae Wong Hospital that encouraged her to get the treatment. Now she lives happily with full-mouth artificial teeth.     ///////////////////////////      "
146,148, Thousands of Thais receive free cataract surgeries   Thu 27 April 2023  ," The Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) covers cataract surgery and eye check-up in the post-surgery stage, improving the quality of life of many Thai people.   Niyom Chuanpair, 64, noticed hervision becoming blurred several months ago. She thought her eyesight had changed, so she visited an optical store to get new glasses.   After undergoing  an eye-checkup, the optician at the store suspected that she did not have a common eyesight problem.   The staff suggested she visit the doctor, who later determined she had cataracts and urgently needed lens replacement surgery.   She first thought the surgery would cost a financial burden on her.   But she soon found out that 100% of its cost was covered by Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) — the Thai government’s healthcare scheme that provides access to affordable healthcare to 47 million people in Thailand.   The surgery was not as complex as she expected. It lasted no more than one day, and she was discharged from the hospital on the same day.       However, the doctor requested she be admitted to the hospital for two-day monitoring as her diabetes might cause complications.   She then returned to normal life with clearer vision after undergoing the treatment.   Niyom’s story reflects the shared experience of thousands of people receiving lens replacement surgery under the UCS, whose quality of life has improved due to accessible healthcare.   One surgery costs between 18,000 and 40,000 baht, depending on the hospital’s charges.   The expensive fee prevented many low-income people from getting the treatments before the introduction of UCS in 2002.    Clear and safe Cataracts are the leading cause of vision impairment and blindness in Thai people and are often found in elder people.   Most cataracts occur due to normal changes in human eyes. As people age, the proteins in the lens of their eye start to break down and clump together — creating cloudy patches that block their vision.   Cataracts can lead to blurred vision and eventually blindness. It can be treated by surgery, which removes the cloudy lens and replaces it with an artificial lens.   The National Health Security Office (NHSO), which oversees UCS, has included lens replacement surgery in the scheme’s benefits package, as the studies suggest it’s one of the most common diseases among Thai elderly people.   In 2021, around 8,700 lens replacement surgeries were operated on for UCS beneficiaries.   The NHSO also negotiated with suppliers to purchase high-quality artificial lenses at the best prices.   “Artificial lenses we used are certified for high quality in the global standard.    They are clear and safe for patients,” said Dr Worapat Wongsawat, deputy director of health system development mission.   “The surgery rarely causes wounds in patients’ eyes. UCS benefits package also covers the cost of treating complications if they occur.”   Treatments are necessary To encourage hospitals to seek patients with cataracts and offer surgeries, the NHSO ensures that all costs that occurred during the treatments will be reimbursed.   Hospitals will receive 7,000 baht in compensation for operating lens replacement surgery for a patient with blindness and severe low vision, and 9,000 baht for a case with complications.   Between 700 and 2,800 baht will be paid for an artificial lens depending on its type.   The NHSO also covers the cost of eye check-ups in the post-surgery stage.    Located in Nakhon Pathom, a state-run Metta Pracharak Hospital is well-known for operating high-quality lens replacement surgeries.   The hospital director Dr Arkom Chaiweerawattana said that the amount of NHSO’s compensation was enough to cover the surgeries and patients don’t need to pay extra.   “Vision impairment, though not a deadly disease, disrupts people’s quality of life and causes burdens to society, including productivity loss in people with vision problems and family members taking care of them,” he said.   “Treatments for their eyes are necessary and important.”            "
147,150," The way forward of Thai UHC:  Address quality and safe care, social determinants of health, primary care, and multi-sectoral collaboration.    Wed 14 December 2022  ","   The way forward of Thai UHC: Address quality and safe care, social determinants of health, primary care, and multi-sectoral collaboration.   Thailand’s Universal Health Coverage (UHC) must improve quality and safe healthcare while addressing social determinants of health, suggested health experts.   Primary care and multi-sectoral collaboration must also be strengthened to ensure the sustainability of the health system in a long run.   On December 9, Thai and international health experts gathered at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to commemorate ‘International Universal Health Coverage Day 2022’ and urge countries around the world to accelerate their progress toward achieving UHC.    The event was co-hosted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Public Health, the National Health Securirty Office (NHSO), and Thai PBS World with the theme set by the United Nations “Build the world we want: A healthy future for all.”   During the event, the panel discussion “Not a bed of roses: 20-year pathway of Thailand’s Universal Health Coverage – challenges and the way forward” was organized to examine the achievement of Thai UHC and address the challenges that needed to be solved.   Thailand achieved UHC in 2002, leading 99% of the Thai population to access affordable and equitable healthcare.    This success is seen as a “miracle” as Thailand was a middle-income country, and still, by the time it achieved UHC. The country was also trying to recover from the 1997 Asian economic crisis then.    Despite this miracle, multiple challenges have emerged in the past recent years.   They include the rising aging population, increasing healthcare costs, and the Covid-19 pandemic that has shaken the health system to its core.   During the panel discussion, health experts emphasized the need to address and solve these challenges with multiple solutions.   Improve quality and safe care  Spoke during the seminar, Dr Jiruth Sriratanaban, a committee of the Healthcare Accreditation Institute of Thailand (HAI), said that the quality and safety of healthcare had been one of the highlighted issues in Thai UHC.    “If we aim to have effective coverage for better health outcomes and equity, coverage is just part of it. You have to make sure that people can also access quality and safe care,” he said.   Dr Jiruth added that countries around the world had also experienced a similar challenge. One study suggests that 10% of hospital-admission patients may experience adverse events, around 10% of leading to mortality.   These errors are not mainly caused by health professionals, but by the imperfect management system.  In Thailand, HAI has collaborated with several organizations, including the NHSO and other healthcare schemes’ operators, the Ministry of Public Health, public health schools, and medical professional bodies to improve quality and safe care.   They co-launched the “Patient and Personnel Safety (2P Safety)” initiative in 2016, in which 850 out of 1,400 hospitals nationwide voluntarily participated.   They report unsafe healthcare incidents to the national system, so governmental and public organizations can learn from the data and find solutions to improve the quality and safety of healthcare services.   “It’s not easy to get hospitals to report their mistakes… But if you can declare errors, you are ready to learn and come up with preventive solutions,” said Dr Jiruth.   The number of reports has increased since the start of the program, showing that hospitals are willing to learn and improve.     On the other hand, the reports of serious adverse incidents (which require medical treatment corrections or result in disabilities and death) have gradually declined — meaning the hospitals can improve their quality and safety of services while reducing medical errors.    Address social determinants of health “If you want to strengthen health security, good management and health system design is the contributor. But, still, you need money. We have to keep the economy growing and come up with mechanisms to distribute wealth to the people,” added Dr Jiruth.   Some studies show that the most critical determinant of health is wealth — resulting in people accessing healthy lifestyles, from having quality education and public transport to good food and nutrition.     Dr Olivia Nieveras, Acting WHO Representative to Thailand, agrees that social determinants of health, especially environmental health and climate change, must be addressed for sustainable healthcare.  “Health is not an isolated issue,” she said.  Dr Nieveras praised the Thai UHC for improving people's health and expanding coverage in the past 20 years, making Thailand at the forefront of the world’s effort to promote and accelerate UHC.    “I want to highlight the importance of quality and safe healthcare. The coverage of the population, health benefits, and financial protections are three dimensions of UHC.  But there is the fourth dimension, which is the quality and safe care,” she said.   There are other challenges needed to be addressed in the following decades of Thai UHC, she added, which include the aging population and the increasing healthcare demands.   Strengthen primary care  Strengthening primary care is one of the areas needed to be improved, said all speakers in the panel discussion.   “We have the health system but it needs to be transformed into the system for health,” suggested Dr Nieveras.   “We need to talk about health promotion and disease prevention rather than treatment… We have to build a health system of wellness rather the illness.”   She said that every individual should contribute to the health system by being collectively responsible to achieve a high level of good health.     Similar to Dr Rungrueng Kijphati, the Public Health Ministry’s representative, who stated during the panel discussion that promoting “self-care” must be included in the goal of UHC.   “Most people focus on treatment. But the most important action is health promotion and disease prevention that encourages Thai people to take care of their health, instead of relying on doctors and hospitals,” he said.   “The health benefits must emphasize health promotion and disease prevention, which must be accessed at the local community level, instead of consolidating at hospitals.”   During the Covid-19 pandemic, primary care became a game changer as it involves the communities, local governments, and health providers in tracking and tracing Covid-19 cases.   It also provided people with entry points for getting timely treatment, reducing the chance for them to spread the virus.   Learning the crucial role of primary care, Dr Rungrueng said that the Public Health Ministry had been working with its partners to increase primary care access — by revising the regulation to allow people to get primary care services at any health unit regardless of their registry addresses.   Enhance multi-sectoral collaboration  Though devastation to the economy and society, the Covid-19 pandemic shows the great benefits of multi-sectoral collaboration to achieve better health outcomes.   In Thailand, Dr Rungrueng observed the launch of many new initiatives during the health crisis that relied on extensive collaboration.   Those include the involvement of pharmacies in caring the coronavirus patients and the increasing use of telemedicine as a platform of collaboration to take care of patients isolated at home.   “Covid makes impossible possible. Unacceptable acceptable. It helps us be more creative. We have learned from the situation that we can keep good things continue, and try to improve not-so-good things,” said Dr Jiruth from HAI.   In response to the pandemic, the HAI wrote a new chapter on telemedicine and home-based care in the hospital accreditation guideline to ensure the quality and safety of both services.   The institute is also working on the policy for standardizing primary care, which will foster and encourage quality improvement. It will be piloted across the country in the next two years.   Phatthanamon Sinsawat, a representative from the International Federation of Medical Students Association (IFMSA-Thailand), said during the panel discussion that multi-sectoral collaboration will be needed for the sustainability of Thai UHC.   The collaboration may be extended to philanthropies and the private sector which can fill up the gap in health finance as the Thai government is being challenged by increasing healthcare expenditure.   She added that the youth could play an important role in the future of UHC, including conducting research and promoting the benefits of UHC on social media.   “We must include all stakeholders in the policy decision, including youth and marginalized people,” she suggested.   “The government should invest more in the public health sector and primary care while expanding the coverage of high-cost health services.”    ////////////////////////////       "
148,151, 20 positive changes contributed by Thai UCS   Tue 13 December 2022  ,"   20 positive changes contributed by Thai UCS    The introduction of the Universal Coverage Scheme two decades ago has contributed to the great advancement of the Thai health system while creating positive social and economic impacts that improve people’s health and lift many out of poverty.   November 19 is the establishment day of the National Health Security Office (NHSO), which is also the day that the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) was introduced in Thailand — leading to the expansion of healthcare coverage to 99% of the Thai population.    The UCS became reality in 2002 under the leadership of the first NHSO secretary-general Dr Sanguan Nitayarumphong, who spearheaded the development of the operational and financial system behind the achievement of UCS.   As 2022 is the 20th year of NHSO’s and UCS’ establishment, the current NHSO secretary-general Dr Jadej Thammathataree said that it was the auspicious time to celebrate the success of UCS and look ahead to the sustainability of UCS in the long run.   The NHSO has set up strategies for each phase of UCS to address the healthcare needs and catch up with the disease trends.   Phase one (2003-2007) highlights the development of health benefits package. Phase two (2008-2011) aims for increasing efficiency of the scheme and levels of public participation.   Phase three (2012-2016) seeks ways to sustain the scheme and expand coverage to everyone living on Thai soil. Phase four (2017-2022) strengthens health finance and good governance.   The fifth phase (2023-2027) will continue steering toward the goals set in the previous phase while focusing on the sustainability of the scheme, expanding primary care coverage and essential care, said Dr Jadej.   It will also address the Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) economic model in UCS management and aim for making NHSO a high-efficient organization.   Multiple targets are set for the fifth phase, including reaching 80% effective health coverage and 89% inpatient compliance rate by 2027.   Health expenditure must not exceed 5% of Thai GDP and 20% of government spending.   The percentage of households experiencing catastrophic health expenditure must be less than 0.25%    “Entering the third decade of NHSO and UCS will need participation from multi-stakeholders to increase the efficiency of our organization and the health scheme,” said Dr Jadej.   A lot of work needs to be done in the future, he said.   In celebration of the establishment of NHSO, it’s worth looking back to the history of UCS which has positively impacted on the health system, and economic and social aspects of Thailand in the past 20 years.   Here are 20 positive changes contributed by UCS.   1. Since the introduction of UCS, the number of households experiencing catastrophic health expenditure declined from 663,000 in 2002 to 475,500 in 2021 — equivalent to 4.06% and 2.10% of Thai households, respectively. In 2002, around 216,000 households, or 1.32% fell under the poverty line because of out-of-pocket health expenses.  This number was reduced to 49,000 or 0.22% in 2021.   2. Several indicators show that the management of UCS fund is highly cost-effective. The NHSO and its partnered organizations have constantly revised the guidelines and criteria of medical fee reimbursement, making the UCS system answer healthcare needs and catch up with new disease trends.   3. The UCS emphasizes public participation by including multi-stakeholders in the decision on the health benefits package and health programs. These stakeholders include health providers, patients, civil society groups, health professionals, and local administrative organizations.   4. The design of UCS benefits package is based on scientific evidence and academic studies. It has involved multiple research institutes, including Health Intervention and Technology Assessment Program (HITAP), Health Systems Research Institute (HSRI), and Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI). This approach helps enhance Thailand’s evidence-based policymaking.   5. The UCS has improved the health outcomes of vulnerable groups, including ethnic minorities, monks, inmates, and undocumented people.   6. Antiretroviral drugs have been included in the UCS benefits package since 2006, saving the lives of several thousand HIV patients. As of 2022, more than 297,000 patients receive antiretroviral drugs regularly under the scheme.   7. Kidney replacement has been provided to UCS beneficiaries since 2008, improving the quality of life of people living with chronic kidney disease. Nearly 63,500 patients receive regular treatments, which cover peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, and kidney transplants. Automated peritoneal dialysis was introduced into the UCS benefits package on February 1, 2022.   8. Treatments for high-cost diseases are introduced in UCS benefits package too, including medication for thalassemia, cancers, and rare diseases, and transplantation for liver, heart, and cornea.   9. Many health programs have been implemented under the UCS to increase people's access to healthcare. Those include oral health checkups in schools and rural areas, fast tracks for patients requiring corneal transplantation, heart valve repair surgery, and surgery for stroke.   10. The UCS ensures access to medicines through the development of drug selection and purchase systems, which covers many types of medicines from generic and orphan drugs to antidotes. This system was co-created by NHSO, Public Health Ministry, Government Pharmaceutical Organization, Thai Red Cross Society, and relevant organizations.   11. Hospital crowding has gradually been reduced by many health programs that keep patients out of hospitals or reduce their time staying at hospitals. These programs include home chemotherapy, homecare, medicine home delivery, telemedicine, and one-day surgery service. One initiative involves community pharmacies as the entry points to primary care, in which patients can consult pharmacists and receive medicines for common diseases without traveling to hospitals.    12. The UCS emphasizes health promotion and disease prevention at all levels — from hospitals and clinics to community health centers.   13. Technology is the major component of UCS management. The NHSO has developed an identification verification system to speed up healthcare services and reimbursement processes while preventing errors and fraudulence. E-claim systems and artificial intelligence are deployed in the audit process. Big data is prioritized and used for collecting health information necessary for research and the improvement of the healthcare scheme.   14. Consumer protection is integrated into the operation of UCS. For example, NHSO launched 1330 contact center where patients can request assistance, suggest solutions, and complain about the healthcare scheme. They can also voice out through NHSO social media platforms, including Facebook and Line. In-person complaint centers are located in hospitals and the NHSO provincial and regional centers. In addition, NHSO sets up a unit to settle medical error cases, many of which receive emergency funds to compensate for the medical errors.   15. The UCS emphasizes the role of local governments in improving the health system. Some initiatives were launched to encourage the contribution of local governments. Those include the Provincial Rehabilitation Fund which provides financial resources to 58 Provincial Administrative Organizations to run rehabilitation centers, and the Long-Term Care fund which aims for improving elderly care in governing areas of 7,028 Local Administrative Organizations (LAOs). Currently, around 99.58% of LAOs, or 7,741 LAOs receive funding under UCS.   16. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the UCS became the mechanism to mobilize health finance for emergency response. Thai people can access free coronavirus testing and treatment, self-test kits, and vaccines. Due to the availability of health funds, the Thai government was able to introduce innovative ways of care. For example, COVID-19 patients can access telemedicine services while isolated at home. The NHSO partnered with local pharmacies to dispatch machines and support pharmacists to provide consultants to mild-symptom patients.   17. The coverage of primary care services has been expanded through UHC. They include, but are not limited to, community mental healthcare, rehabilitation, palliative care, and Thai traditional medicines.   18. Increase healthcare access is one of the key goals of UCS. Four policies are implemented to increase access; “OP Anywhere” which beneficiaries can request free primary care at any health entry points; “Cancer Anywhere” which beneficiaries can get cancer treatment at any hospital regardless of their hospital registry; inter-hospital transfer without using paper documents; and online re-register with hospitals of beneficiaries’ choices and be effective immediately.   19. Thailand’s UHC achievement brings the country to the forefront of the global health agenda. It has been a strong supporter of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, which include the world’s ambition to achieve UHC by 2030. On UHC Day, (December 12) Thailand has shown a strong position to promote UHC and urges all leaders to accelerate their effort to increase people’s access to quality and affordable care.   20. Despite achieving UHC, the health benefits of each of the Thai government’s healthcare schemes are still different and unequal. The NHSO has pushed forward the close of this gap, including the launch of Universal Coverage for Emergency Patients (UCEP) and equalizing the health benefits in the areas of long-term and palliative care for the elderly.        "
149,153, Explaining UCS benefits package Q&A with NHSO Deputy Secretary-General Dr Athaporn Limpanyalers    Mon 03 October 2022  ," Explaining UCS benefits package Q&A with NHSO Deputy Secretary-General Dr Athaporn Limpanyalers    Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS), initially known as ”30-baht for all health services” was introduced in Thailand in 2002 and insure more than 47.7 million Thais.   Its benefits package has been improved in the past two decades to increase people’s access to necessary health services.   The UCS covers treatments for nearly 100% of diseases, including high-cost ones, which save the lives of many Thais.   UCS is introduce and implement as a pilot project for a year before the National Health Security Act B.E. 2545 (A.D. 2002) legalized by the parliament and promulgated in Royal Gazette on November 18, 2002, it was established the National Health Security Office (NHSO) and has duty to manage the of UCS, the scheme’s budget, improve benefits package and regulations/guidelines   The NHSO is tasked with achieving a big mission — making “health for all” possible.  The UCS covers various comprehensive health items and services under the NHSO’s different payment methods, ensuring that health providers will be confident to provide free healthcare services to the patients.   However, some health providers and UCS beneficiaries may find the information about the scheme’s coverage confusing.   The NHSO Deputy Secretary-General Dr Athaporn Limpanyalers answered frequently asked questions regarding the UCS health benefits.   What is the UCS?    The UCS is the Thai government’s healthcare scheme legalized by the National Health Security Act B.E. 2545 (A.D. 2002). It is 100% tax-funded or government budget.   The funding is directed to numeral types of comprehensive health services, including pregnancy care, health promotion and disease prevention, medical diagnosis, physical and mental health treatments, rehabilitation, and ambulance service.   It also covers compensation for health workers, medicine, medical devices and equipment. “In summary, the UCS covers healthcare for a human in all stages of life — from in the womb to the final chapter of life,” said Dr Athaporn.   What are the UCS’s current health benefits?    The NHSO adds new health benefits to the UCS every year, to cover all types of necessary healthcare services for its beneficiaries.   The year 2022 is considered a big move as the number of new items and services included in the scheme’s benefits packages is higher than in the past years.   These include screening tests for inherited metabolic disorders and hearing loss in newborns, thalassemias and syphilis in women’s partners.   Oral cancer screening, free orphan drugs and adult diapers are among the new items added to the benefits package this year.   Starting from 2022, drug-addicted persons voluntarily seeking rehabilitation can also get free support under the UCS. Some types of fertility treatment are also included.   What are health services not covered under the UCS? The UCS does not cover some health services and items, including cosmetic surgery,medical diagnosis and treatment in the experimental stages.   Some types of organ transplantations are not covered too, except for the services for treating heart disease and cirrhosis in adults and liver failure in children under 18 years old.      What is the process of adding new health benefits?    The NHSO has organized public hearings every year to gather opinions and suggestions from multi-stakeholders and understand their needs for health services.   The stakeholders include patients, civil society groups, health providers, and authorities.   Their suggestions are taken into the NHSO’s consideration seriously, often leading to evidence-based studies that confirm the cost-effectiveness of proposed health benefits.   The NHSO sets a goal to include as many as health items and services demanded by UCS beneficiaries, said Dr Athaporn, while increasing access to existing benefits.   Recently, the NHSO has paid attention to new technology that can increase healthcare access and convenience for patients.   For example, the NHSO has implemented Authentication system, the identity verification technology that allows UCS beneficiaries to get free healthcare services by just showing Thai identification cards at health units.   It also launched a mobile application that helps UCS beneficiaries book doctor appointments and register for some health benefits, including free flu and covid-19 vaccine.   Dr Athaporn added that the NHSO publicly announced new health benefits every year to ensure transparency and access to all new benefits.

150,155, Success story: Songkhla expands local access to rehabilitation therapy    Wed 07 September 2022  ,"          The local government of Songkhla initiates a program to improve life quality of elderly, bedridden, and disabled people, with support from Provincial Rehabilitation Fund (PRF) overseen by the National Health Security Office (NHSO).   The PRF provides financial assistance to provincial governments submitting health project proposals to the NHSO.   It’s one of the mechanisms that distribute financial resources to local governments, which know best about local people’s health issues.    In Songkhla, Thailand’s southern province, funding under the PRF has been used to invest in expanding rehabilitation centers, hiring physiotherapists and purchasing equipment to assist marginalized groups.   Rehabilitation center   Khao Rup Chang is one of Songkhla’s districts that participate in activities funded by the PRF.   “Our district has many elderly and disabled people demanding support. To get financial resources, we submitted the proposal to the NHSO to purchase equipment for our target groups and fund rehabilitation therapy services,” said Jakthon Surisang, mayor of Khao Rup Chang Municipality.   “We also signed an MoU with Songkhla Hospital to seek help for technical support. Our residents can now access rehabilitation therapy in our center located in their community's territory. They don’t need to travel to hospitals and wait in long queues like before.”   Under the PRF, the municipality can hire two physiotherapists at the rehabilitation center, cover transportation fees for local people visiting the center and develop a mobile application to assist them with booking appointments.   The municipality co-funds some activities under the PRF to ensure the quality and adequacy of health services.   Fixing service center   Under the PRF, the service for fixing equipment used by people living with disabilities is made available. The service has been provided at Hatyai Technical College since three years ago.   Aek Kwanprom, manager of the fixing service center, said that his center receives around 40 to 50 requests a month. The requests include fixing wheelchairs, bed aids and seats for disabled people.   It also allows disabled people to borrow equipment and return once they have their own. Each center was set up with a 500,000-baht budget and didn’t charge disabled people requesting its services.   “We hire disabled people to fix equipment at our center. They went through training and were hired by a private company. We signed an MoU with 14 organizations, including Songkhla Disabled People Association, which agreed on providing jobs to disabled people in our community,"" said Aek.   The center has been expanded into three locations across Songkhla province. His team is planning to add one more soon.   Elder care    Songkhla Provincial Administrative Organization opened an elder care center four years ago, also with support from the PRF.   It first targeted only elder people. But due to increasing demand, it expands the services to general people who require rehabilitation therapy and Thai traditional medicine services.   Kanokchon Poontheeraton, the physiotherapist at the center, said that her staff plans to include home care services for bedridden patients in the near future.   “We’ve worked closely with Songkhla Hospital and Ministry of Public Health district hospitals to provide seamless care to patients. Many of them can get health services at our center and will be transferred to advancing hospitals if needed,” she said.   “We’ve collaborated with village health volunteers to identify patients needing rehabilitation therapy.”    Paijen Maksuwan, Chief Executive of the Songkhla Provincial Administrative Organization, said that his organization plans to expand the rehabilitation centers to 19 locations in 16 districts.   Currently, 11 centers are in operation. He said that elder patients will be able to stay overnight at the center when the facilities are ready.   “The purpose of expanding the centers is to increase access to rehabilitation care timely and ensure health equally,” he said.    “We find many local people can’t afford the trips to hospitals because they live far from the urban areas. We want them to get health services no different from those living in cities.”   In addition, his organization provides financial assistance to residents who want to modify their houses to serve family members living with disabilities.   The modification includes building a ramp and installing grab bars. The amount of funds is between 20,000 and 60,000 baht.   Ensure health equity   “The NHSO has built local government’s capacity in recording health data, helping their staff understand our claiming process,” said the NHSO secretary-general Dr Jadej Thammathatacharee.   ""The data can be uploaded to our Cloud and is useful for understanding health issues of local people in a long term.   Though the rehabilitation centers run by the local government can’t provide advancing medical services like the big hospitals, Dr Jadej believes that they are important for ensuring health equity.   ""These centers also help reduce hospital crowd and allow patients to get essential health services whenever they need them,” said Dr Jadej.         "
151,157, UCS constantly improves through thick and thin: Anutin   Fri 24 June 2022  ,"  UCS constantly improves through thick and thin: Anutin   A core principle as to why the universal coverage scheme (UCS) has been initiated as a national health security system is that every Thai citizen should have a healthcare right so that no one will literally risk going bankrupt as a result of paying high medical bills.   Some may be covered under the Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme (CSMBS) as others are receiving healthcare under the Social Security Scheme (SSS). Those who aren’t members of either the CSMBS or the SSS, meanwhile, are automatically entitled to receiving the healthcare right under the UCS.   Over the past two to three years, the UCS has been encountering a major challenge-- dealing with the COVID-19 crisis while having to continue improving the quality of also non-COVID-19 healthcare services.   Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Public Health Anutin Charnvirakul has made an interesting point as to how the UCS has so far managed to cope with these enormous difficulties, in his interview on a talk show, Khui Ruang Ban Khui Ruang Muang Khui Thuk Ruang Kap Ratthamontri, which was broadcast on Radio Thailand on June 11, 2022.   He has pointed out that the UCS is the strength of Thailand’s health system and the main reason why the country has survived after outbreak of COVID-19 and successfully minimised the number of deaths claimed by the coronavirus infection.   Thailand’s success in COVID-19 responses and resilience has been recognised internationally, proof of how strong the country’s healthcare system is with the UCS being an essential element of it, said Mr Anutin.   A core work principle behind this notable success was a belief that no one is safe until everyone is safe, which has been adopted by all parties working to contain the spread of the coronavirus and save lives of the patients infected with the virus, he said.   This ideology has also helped curb disparities in access to healthcare as people are treated equally -- disregarding of their financial status -- when receiving treatment and other healthcare services related to COVID-19 infection and prevention, he said.   Dealing with COVID-19 in the past two to three years, the UCS was required to adjust constantly to the changing outbreak situation, he said.   In the beginning, as the government had stepped in to ensure sufficient access to medical treatment for all people infected with the coronavirus all patients were admitted to the hospital for treatment, he said.    However, now that Omicron, the highly transmissible yet less virulent strain has become the dominant variant, there are no need for hospital admissions of non-severe cases, which are now the majority of new infections, he said.   The National Health Security Office (NHSO) has therefore adopted more treatment and care options including home isolation and tele-medicine in order to allow those infected people with no or mild symptoms to stay home and continue as much as possible with their daily life activities, he said.   This way, hospital beds are reserved for the people who suffer severe disease when they are infected with the coronavirus, he said.   As a result, the hospital bed occupancy rate now is less than 20%, while more respirators are available for use in an emergency, he said, adding that this is how the UCS has adjusted to the changing COVID-19 situation.   Aside from the success in managing the COVID-19 crisis, he said, the UCS is also committed to continually improving its services and expanding its benefits package to cover more diseases and treatments.   Since taking office around the middle of 2019, this government has been trying to close the gaps in the country’s healthcare system by improving constantly the UCS’ benefit package such as allowing kidney patients to choose their desired kidney dialysis method, he said.   In the past, only the costs of peritoneal dialysis (PD) and haemodialysis using a dialyzer which was approved by doctors as being necessary were covered  under the UCS, he said.   Those whose doctors didn’t approve their request for haemodialysis who insisted on receiving haemodialysis instead of PD had to pay for about 1,500 baht per time of haemodialysis, which normally is required twice or three times a week, he said.   Back then each of such kidney patients had to shoulder the costs of haemodialysis services on their own, which normally cost about 20,000 baht per person per month, he said, adding that that was a large burden on them.   “Before the haemodialysis benefit was added, some doctors working at a kidney dialysis clinic had told me if this specific healthcare benefit wasn’t included soon, there would be a number of patients who would have to die after they ran out of money to pay for their haemodisalysis costs,” said Mr Anutin.   “Upon learning about that, I instantly discussed the matter with the NHSO secretary-general and then proposed for the board of the NHSO to approve it, which they did. I was so glad that they unanimously approved the proposal,” he said.   “From now on, every patient suffering end-stage kidney failure is able to choose his or her desired method of kidney dialysis and receive it free of charge,” he said. “I’m really glad to be a part of this successful attempt to improve the kidney dialysis service, which has added more happiness to the patients and their family.”   The provision of adult diapers to bed-ridden patients is another new benefit added to the UCS’ benefit package recently with an aim to improve the quality of life of the bed-bound patients, mostly the elderly people, he said.   Allowing cancer patients to choose a cancer-treating hospital that best suits their needs is another important benefit added previously under the UCS, which has greatly improved convenience  and results of cancer treatment for patients in all parts of the country, he said.   “These are only some examples of new benefits added to the UCS’ core benefit package,” he said.  “I’ve stressed with the NHSO secretary-general that it is very important to assure the people about their health security and make them confident in the healthcare services provided by the government.” ///    "
152,158, Ensure health services standard and quality control   Wed 08 June 2022  ,"   Ensure health services standard and quality control   An administrative mechanism is a crucial element of Thailand’s Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS), covering healthcare for nearly 49 million people.   One of the core mechanisms is the National Health Security (NHS) Board (chaired by the Public Health Minister and comprised of multistakeholder representing health providers and purchasers, health professionals, patients, and relevant authorities.   The NHSO board is well known by the public as it determines core health policies and makes decisions on multiple issues, including the introduction of the UCS’ new benefits package and health programs.   But there is another important element of the UCS’s administrative mechanism that is often unknown to the public the Standard and Quality Control  (SQC) Board   The main duty of the SQC board is to monitor and evaluate the policies implemented by the NHS board, protect the patients’ rights and provide advice on the scheme’s budget allocation.     To ensure participation and transparency, the SQC board is joined by representatives from multi-sectors, including public and private hospitals, health professionals, patient groups, non-profit organizations, and local governments at provincial, municipal, and district levels.    Dr Supan Srithamma, the SQC board’s chairman, said that the COVID-19 pandemic affected health services quality throughout 2020 and 2021.   The health crisis disrupted most of the essential health services. Health workers must focus on the coronavirus emergency response while patients were unable to visit the hospitals under the social distancing measures.   Under these constraints, health workers found difficulties ensuring health services quality.    On the other hand, members of the SQC board and its regional and provincial offices couldn’t meet hospital staff to provide assistance on monitoring and evaluation.   Despite the challenges, Dr Supan said that the SQC board managed to perform its duties which are,   1. Promote and improve health service quality: The SQC staff worked closely with health providers to ensure health services standards and quality control. During the pandemic, the collaborations were taken online and offline to overcome the social distancing challenges.   In addition, the SQC board set up online and offline channels for patients to complain about unfair and overcharged medical bills.   2. Advice on the NHSO’s budget allocation: The SQC board provided advice to the NHSO board on how to allocate the annual budget for the UCS’ health programs and activities.   Its suggestion helped the NHSO board develop the budget proposal for submitting to the Thai cabinet.    3. Improve the guidelines that help patients settle the dispute with health providers: The SQC board developed the guidelines, which included step-by-step instruction on how patients can submit the complaints and seek compensation or remedies if their rights are violated by health providers.   Currently, patients can submit complaints through channels, including the NHSO 1330contact center, the NHSO’s regional offices, and the provincial health offices. The SQC board also opened 126 complaint Units Section 50 (5) around the country.    4. Scrutinize the compensations for patients experiencing medical errors: In 2021, 1,026 patients requested compensation for medical errors.   The SQC board approved 845 requests or 82% of the submitted complaints.   5. Improve the capacity of SQC regional offices: The SQC board supported the capacity-building activities for its staff in regional and provincial offices.   The activities include training and monthly meeting among the offices’ staff to discuss standard and quality control strategies.   Dr Supan said the SQC’s 2022 strategy will focus on multiple areas.   One of those is to encourage more collaboration between the SQC staff and relevant organizations, including the Healthcare Accreditation Institute under the Ministry of Public Health, the royal colleges, and health professional councils.   The collaboration will improve the implementation of standard and quality control as it involves multi players in the health system, he said.   As of June, the SQC board has achieved some milestones, including finalizing the four-year plan for improving health services standards and quality control (2020-2024).    The plan highlights access to health services for patients living with life-threatening diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, and kidney failure.   It will also promote the quality of health promotion and disease prevention services as well as new health initiatives, including telemedicine and access to primary care at any health unit regardless of the patients’ registered hospitals.   Last but not least, the SQC board has developed quality indicators that have been adopted by the regional and provincial offices. Having the indicators will help SQC board evaluate health providers and their health services effectively.          "
153,160," More than 26,000 women get cervical cancer tests in Loei   Thu 19 May 2022  ","  More than 26,000 women get cervical cancer tests in Loei   This year, hospitals and health centers in Thailand's northeastern Loei province target more than 26,000 women for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) DNA tests.   In collaboration with Loei Provincial Health Office, these health units have encouraged local women between 30 and 60 to get tests as part of its health promotion and disease prevention program.   All women in the target age range are eligible for free tests regardless of their registered health care schemes.   HPV DNA test is a laboratory test in which cells are scraped from the cervix to look for DNA of human papillomaviruses (HPV), which is the cause of cervical cancer.   It has been included in Thailand's Universal Health Coverage since Jun 2019 to replace the pap smear, a type of cervical cancer screening test that is less successful in assessing cervical cancer risk than the HPV DNA test.   Hospitals providing HPV DNA test can claim the cost from the National Health Security Office (NHSO), which act as a clearinghouse while overseeing the government's Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS).    Dr Bancha Phalanuwong, the Director of Loei Hospital, said that his staff had collaborated with the provincial health office, heads of community hospitals, and primary health units to offer the test to women living in Loei province.   They have run an annual campaign to encourage women to have tests. Around 34,000 women in Loei province were tested last year. Thirty-eight of them had cervical cancer.     This year's campaign, targeting 26,088 women, is run from Apr 1 to Sep 30.   If any of them get positive test results, meaning they have a type of high-risk HPV linked to cervical cancer, they will get free colposcopy once a year to monitor and track tumor cells.     If they develop cancer, they will be transferred to cancer centers in more advanced hospitals. ""Cervical cancer is the second most frequent cancer. But it can be completely treated, without any complications, if the patients have early diagnosis and treatment,"" said Dr Bancha.   ""In many cases, we found that women felt embarrassing to go through the test, especially when they found male doctors conducting the tests. We must assign these jobs to the right physicians and prepare our laboratory for daily testing during the campaign.""    Loei Hospital has run a laboratory certified by the Public Health Ministry's Medical Sciences Department.   It can conduct the tests for other hospitals and health centers, of which staff focuses more on collecting samples.   Suwimon Jobdee, head of Ban Phon Pa Daeng Subdistrict Health Center, said that her center would join the HPV DNA test campaign for the first time this year.   Her staff has collaborated with village health volunteers in encouraging women to get tests.   Village health volunteers have visited local communities and surveyed women in each household to determine if they want to have tests.   They have also provided these women with information about the benefits of the tests.   ""Loei province displays a good example of an effective and widely-coverage cervical cancer test campaign.    This success relies on the close collaboration among different players in the health sector from provincial health office, hospitals, and health centers to health volunteers,"" said the NHSO Deputy Secretary-General Dr. Athaporn Limpanyalers   ""They have also had a good preparation, including ensuring the availability of laboratory and technicians who can provide test results timely and accurately.""   /////////////////////////           "

The program is proved to be highly beneficial for parents and local communities.""      The 1,000 days of miracle program is funded by the Community Health Fund under the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS).   The fund, managed by the NHSO, provides local administrative organizations and their partners with financial resources for any health programs.   In this case, PTCHC partners with Thon Samo municipality when requesting the fund from the NHSO.   The introduction of the Community Health Fund is part of the NHSO's effort to increase local participation in the health system while distributing resources to local organizations which know best about local health problems and solutions.    The participation has created a sense of ownership for UCS, the way to sustain the scheme for the long run.        Pornrung Muenpong, head of Thon Samo Municipality's public health department, said that his municipality's past health programs had focused on postpartum and elderly care, partly because of the lack of financial resources.     The 1,000 days of miracle program has filled up the gap in the municipality's health programs by extending them to prenatal care.   ""We thank the PTCHC for initiating the program. We will support the health center and any other proposed health programs,"" said Pornrung.    The NHSO Secretary-General Dr Jadej Thammatacharee said that the NHSO had prioritized prenatal and postpartum care because it primarily affected child development and determined individuals' health outcomes when reaching adulthood.   ""This year, we increased health benefits for mothers. They can now request antenatal care from health units unlimitedly. Previously, they could only get it in five visits.   They don't need to pay because the NHSO will reimburse the medical fees for health providers,"" said Dr Jadej.   /////////////            "
155,164, Reduce access to non-COVID care    Thu 10 March 2022  ,"   Reduce access to non-COVID care    A new study finds that access to non-COVID health services in Thailand declined while excess death rose during the pandemic.   The study, conducted by the International Health Policy Program (IHPP) and endorsed by the National Health Security board, covers the period from Apr 2020 to Sep 2021 — when COVID-19 first wave (Jan-Dec 2020), second (Dec 2020-Mar 2021), third (Apr 2021) and fourth (Dec 2021) were reported in Thailand.    Dr Viroj Tangcharoensathien, Senior adviser to IHPP, revealed that the study found overall inpatient visits had dropped by 14.1% compared to the pre-COVID period. The admission rate declined the most (by 29%) during the pandemic’s first wave.   Health service access for emergency and critical non-COVID patients also fell during the study period.    The admission rate for patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), a type of heart attack that causes severe complications and death, was reported to sink by 6.8%.    Re-admission rates within 28 days after discharging from the inpatient ward surged by 32.5% on average. The re-admission rate was inflated by 82.2% and 104.9% during the first and third COVID-19 waves.   For patients with stroke, the admission rate and access to a thrombolytic or a clot buster drug. shrunk by 7.4% and 13%, respectively.     Dr Viroj said a similar trend was reported among patients with chronic disease, of which the admission rate plunged by 12.1%.    The admission rate for hypertension patients decreased by 2.2%. Their hospital visits rose by 12.2% after the COVID-19 first wave, while their hospital mortality rate increased by 6.7%.   Inpatient admission rate for those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma reduced by 8.9% and 29.8%, respectively. The hospital mortality rate for asthma patients hiked by 48%, while the patients’ demand for ventilators increased by 46.7%.     The surgical rate in elderly patients also declined drastically, which was observed through cataract surgical rate (CSR) (reduced by 14.1%) and Arthroplasty or Joint replacement surgery (42.1%).   Cancer patients’ admission rate and access to chemotherapy plummeted by 4.6% and 10%, respectively. The hospital mortality rate for patients with kidney failure rose by 10.2%.   Access to maternal and child health (MCH) has been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The IHPP study finds maternal mortality rate surged by 153.4%, especially during the fourth coronavirus wave that saw the rate soared by 450.9% due to maternal coronavirus infections.   Miscarriage cases increased between 10% and 20% during the second and third waves.   Preeclampsia cases rose by 27.9% during the second wave because mothers couldn’t properly access prenatal care during the lockdown.   “These numbers show the negative impacts of the pandemic on access to healthcare services.   But there was also a positive impact on infectious disease, including in patients with seasonal flu whose admission rate declined by 80% to 90% during the study period. This resulted from social distancing and mask-wearing,” said Dr Viroj.   The study also looks at the excess mortality rate for non-COVID cases. For example, the excess mortality rate for male patients with respiratory infection increased from 21.3% to 28.5% between 2020 and 2021, while female patients rose from 7.6% to 11.3% in the same period of time.    The excess mortality rate from parasite infection surged by 24% in males and 75.3% in females, and 3.8% in men and 4.6% in females with non-communicable diseases.   “This finding proves the necessity of health facilities’ preparation for the spread of Omicron variant, which may lead us to experience to the fifth wave,” said Dr Viroj.   “We urge the hospital managers to review their business continuity plans, which should ensure emergency care access for non-COVID patients and lower their death rate.”   Encouraging the coronavirus asymptomatic or mild-symptom patients to isolate at home or community isolation facilities is necessary for reserving health resources for emergency non-COVID patients. Hospitals should prioritize emergency cases.    Ensuring people’s access to quality self-test kits and vaccines is also vital for reducing emergency cases among coronavirus patients, suggested Dr Viroj.       "
156,165, Health justice as fundamental human right in academic views   Thu 10 Febuary 2022  ,"  Health justice as fundamental human right in academic views   When COVID-19 vaccines were scarcely available in Thailand during the first and second wave of the outbreak, migrant workers, for instance, were deprived of access to vaccination and weren’t entitled to receiving COVID-19 relief measures as were their Thai counterparts.   And around the time the government had shifted its vaccination distribution policy to focus more on supporting efforts to revive the tourism-based economy, certain groups of even Thai people themselves had to wait longer for their turns to get a COVID-19 shot provided by the government.   Also, during a past peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in Bangkok, the hospital bed shortage was largely blamed for resulting in incidents in which a number of COVID-19 infected patients had died at home while waiting for a bed.   These are examples of what is referred to as “health injustice” in an academic point of view included into a study being conducted by a group of health and rights academics in Thailand, in a bid to better understand the “health justice” concept through exploring over what had happened in the past couple of years of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may be regarded as problems facing health justice.   What is health justice?   Spearheaded by Dr Somsak Chunharas, the president of the National Health Foundation, Health Justice Project is an initiative established by a group of Thai health and rights academics with cooperation with their international fellow researchers and activists.   Attempting to get the health justice concept across in Thailand, Assoc Prof Borwornsom Leerapan of Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University who serves as a lead author of the project has admitted that this really is a complicated matter as it involves several areas of work.   And although it is related to those more familiar terms such as health disparities, health equality and health equity, justice and injustice in health are actually something different, he said.   He was speaking at a side meeting of the Prince Mahidol Award Conference 2022 held on Jan 24, 2022 and dedicated to discussions about health justice with the main focus on lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic.   “COVID-19 has actually provided an opportunity for learning more about health justice” he said.   Three areas in Health Justice   To give a clearer idea as to what health justice actually is Assoc Prof Borwornsom Leerapan cited a health justice framework drafted under the Health Justice Project.   According to the framework, there are three areas of health justice, namely Procedural Justice (PJ), Distributive Justice (DJ) and Corrective Justice (CJ).   PJ consists of accuracy, consistency, impartiality, reversibility, transparency and voice, he said.   In short, good governance is the key indicator of PJ, he said.   “To me, it’s a minimum requirement that the people will have to maintain good governance when they are involved in the policy-making process, regardless of how the outcome of the policy will turn,” he said.   In case of COVID-19 containment, for example, if a policy is proved to be successful in controlling the spread of the coronavirus yet lacks transparency in the policy-making process or lacks participation by stakeholders concerned, it could never be regarded as being a just policy, he said.   DJ comprises five principles, namely efficiency, necessity, the right to health, affordability and equal opportunities, he said.   It’s also the government’s responsibility to ensure how to implement its just policy with an aim to achieve all these principles, he said.   An example of CJ in case of the COVID-19 pandemic includes a set of measures created to compensate for any losses caused to any parties as a result of the implementation of a policy, which in this case includes the national vaccination programme, he said.   The no-fault financial compensation programme being implemented by the National Health Security Office (NHSO) for the people suffering adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination is recognised as a form of CJ, he said.   Still, more could be done to achieve even better CJ in the government’s handling of the COVID-19 outbreak, he said.   “Not only healthcare services that determine the outcome of healthcare but also several other factors, including social determinants of health,” he said.   Thailand may have last year done well with containing the spread of COVID-19; but it actually hadn’t done well enough in coping with the socioeconomic hardship associated with the outbreak, he said.   Three case studies Aphaluck Bhatiasevi, a medical anthropology scholar with the Health Justice Project, meanwhile, highlighted three case studies which were based on data and information gathered through media reports and via the social media regarding health injustice in Thailand during the past waves of COVID-19.   The first one dealt with injustice identified in the national COVID-19 prevention and control, while the second case study dealt with injustice found in Thailand’s public health resource management and COVID-19 vaccine procurement and distribution.   The third case study concerned injustice observed in the handling of the country’s workforce, economy and access to healthcare during the past waves of COVID-19.   “The government’s COVID-19 responses were largely prescriptive and based on centralized decision-making while the outbreak situation varies in different locations,” said Ms Aphaluck.   A clear example of injustice observed in the third case study, for example, is when the informal workers, temporary workers, daily workers and freelance workers were during the third wave of the COVID-19 outbreak denied access to the three-month financial compensation of 5,000 baht each, which was offered exclusively to only those workers registered under the social security system, she said.   The fact is there were more than 20.4 million informal workers in the country by then, she said.   From her experience in working in the Thai-Myanmar border area in Mae Sot district of Tak province, Dr Nuttagarn Chuancheun of Mae Sot Hospital said she has observed a lot of health justice there.   So, to improve health justice in this border area, she said, she and her colleagues share a common mindset that Thai and non-Thai patients should be entitled to receiving the same standard of healthcare despite their different healthcare rights assigned to them by the state.   More problems that also need attention   As side from the problems highlighted in the three case studies, Assoc Prof Nipon Paopongsakorn of Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI) said there still are more problems related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic which urgently requires attention.   They are an increasing proportion of persons opting out of the labour force due to their hopelessness to find a new job during the pandemic and a higher proportion of youths giving up education or training during the same period of time, he said.   “What the pandemic has done is [that it] has exposed problems concerning justice and equity in health,” said former prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva who is actively involved in a global initiative aimed at improving health justice in all parts of the world.   Prof Lincoln Chen of the China Medical Board agreed that if these problems had not been exposed by the pandemic, they would continue to have been swept under the carpet.   A proof of these problems is social distancing, which in reality is a luxury good that the people living in densely populated communities, migrant workers, and the vulnerable groups cannot afford, said Mr Abhisit.   On a global scale, COVID-19 vaccine distribution, for instance, is a key issue that needs to be tackled to ensure fair distribution for the whole world, he said.   “What had motivated us to move towards health justice was that the term ‘justice’ has to be action-oriented and dynamic,” he said.   More views on how to improve health justice   Transparency and public participation are the key to success in ensuring that health justice is treated as a fundamental human right, said Sanitsuda Ekkachai, a columnist with The Bangkok Post.   In case of the national COVID-19 vaccine procurement and distribution, for example, if opinions by the people who will have to use the vaccine will never be heard by those officials deciding on this work, the work will never meet the public needs, said Akkarasorn Opilan, a columnist and activist with the Disrupt website.   “I certainly hope that we now have a better and clearer idea as to what health justice could do as a fundamental way to improve health inequity,” said Dr Somsak.   ///    "
157,167, Phuket: A case study on the possibility of living with COVID-19   Wed 02 Febuary 2022  ,"  Phuket: A case study on the possibility of living with COVID-19   Phuket demonstrates the possibility of living with COVID-19.   The famous island of southern Thailand has been reopened to international tourists since July last year, under the Phuket Sandbox scheme that focuses on bringing back tourists for economic recovery.   Several health measures have been experimented with under the scheme to find the best way to recover tourism while ensuring the safety of local people.    During Thailand's second wave last year, inbound international tourists must be vaccinated and stay on the island for 14 days before traveling to other parts of the country.  They must also go through regular coronavirus testing.   This strict measure aimed to prevent coronavirus transmission from tourists to local people.  However, limited freedom of movement also discouraged international tourists from visiting Phuket.    Local and public health authorities and the tourism business sector learned the lesson.  When the second wave receded in Oct last year, they adjusted the measure by reducing mandatory days for staying on the island from 14 to seven days.   Test & Go scheme has been offered to international tourists since Nov 1, in which vaccinated tourists from anywhere in the world are exempted from quarantine.  But they must take the COVID-19 test on arrival and go straight to hotel rooms.  Once the test result is confirmed negative, they are free to leave.  It takes around one day to get the test result.   ""Phuket Sandbox seeks for a balance between the economy and healthcare amidst the pandemic,"" said Dr Kusak Kukiattikoon, Phuket Provincial Chief Medical Office.   ""We've achieved to find this balance through multi-sectoral collaboration.  All players from local administrative and public health authorities to hotel and tour operators have worked together to design the right measures for Phuket people and tourists.""   Provide care to a diverse population    Phuket makes use of the existing spider-web healthcare network to handle the pandemic.  The island is a location for some public and private hospitals.  The staff of these health units have collaborated and shared information to trace and track coronavirus cases in a diverse population.   In addition, state hospital staff have long-established networks with health volunteers, civil society groups, and local clinics to implement health promotion and disease prevention programs to local communities.     Dr Weerasak Lawtongkum, director of Vachira Phuket Hospital, said that such networks had helped health professionals and workers manage the pandemic effectively.    Thais receive free COVID-19 healthcare services under the government's three healthcare schemes: Universal Coverage Scheme, Social Security Scheme, and Civil Servant Medical Benefits.   Because Phuket is a tourist destination, public hospitals have established centers for assisting foreign patients even before the pandemic.  The centers, of which health staff have built networks with hotel and tourism associations, became a contact point for coronavirus cases in tourists and expatriate communities.   Currently, the infection rate of international tourists on arrival is 1.3%, or around 50 out of 4,000 tourists landing at the International Phuket Airport each day.  The infection rate increases to 4% after tourists stay in Phuket for five to six days.  They mainly get the virus from local people.   Migrant workers, the main workforces in Phuket's tourism sector, have received assistance through Vachira Phuket Hospital's Supanimit Center and civil society groups.  Healthcare staff have conducted active case finding in migrant worker communities and provided them with medicine and treatment during their isolation.   Synthesis of tourism and healthcare sectors    ""Tourism sector in Phuket has a long history of collaborating with the public health sector. For example, hotel operators have requested public health staff to inspect hotel facilities' hygiene,"" said Kongsak Khoopongsakorn, the Thai Hotel Association Southern Chapter's President.      ""We have remained and even extended collaboration during the pandemic.""   The collaboration includes the management of hospitels, the hotels turned into COVID-19 quarantine facilities, and the implementation of the Test and Go policy.   In the past months, tourists who tested positive under the Phuket Sandbox scheme have been allowed to quarantine at hotel rooms instead of moving them to hospitals.  This helps reduce the demands of hospital beds, which should be spared for serving critical patients.    Kongsak said that not every hotel had the capacity to manage hotel room isolation. To solve this challenge, hotel operators and the public health authority worked together to introduce ""international community isolation,""  in which hotels with high capacity may provide a temporary shelter for infected touristed before they are transferred to hospitals or hospitels.   ""We've complied with recommendations from the public health authority and changed the way we run our facilities to ensure the safety of tourists and our staff,"" said Kongsak.   ""We have regular meetings with the Phuket governor, public officials, and relevant organizations to update real-time situations and discuss the solutions that are right and acceptable for everyone.""   Rapid mass vaccination   Along with the multi-sectoral collaboration, the achievement of Phuket Sandbox has depended largely on the COVID-19 vaccination program.   Prof Dr Virasakdi Chongsuvivatwong, Advisor to the Ministry of Public Health, said that the idea of Phuket's border reopening had emerged before the vaccines were available.      Local authorities introduced 'bubble and seal' measures, allowing tourists from selected countries to enter the island. But it didn't succeed because none of the countries could control the spread of the virus at that time.  The free flow of tourists would put local people at health risk, concerned local authorities.   When the Thai government obtained the vaccines in mid-2021,  Phuket authorities and local businesses didn't hesitate to initiate and speed up the mass vaccination program.   Within three months, over 75% of Phuket residents were fully vaccinated, making the launch of the Phuket Sandbox scheme possible and safe.   The last-year research on local vaccine recipients found that vaccination was a game-changer.  It has increased immunization among the local population and reduced the risk of facing the uncontrollable spread of the virus.   In Jan, the health authority began to provide local people with the second booster shots.  Severe cases are reported very low in Phuket, allowing tourism activities to carry on despite the spread of Omicron.   ""Of course, we still need to keep an eye on the situation and be alert for new variants,"" said Prof Dr Virasakdi.   ""Phuket has proved to the world that living with COVID-19 is possible and safe.""      "
158,169, NHSB gives nod to reimbursement payment for kidney patients opting for HD   Mon 17 January 2022  ,"  NHSB gives nod to reimbursement payment for kidney patients opting for HD   The National Health Security Board (NHSB) had on Jan 6, 2022 endorsed a proposal to reimburse patients with chronic kidney failure who opt for hemodialysis (HD) instead of peritoneal dialysis (PD), effective Feb 1, 2022.   Peritoneal dialysis is a type of dialysis which uses the peritoneum in a person's abdomen as the membrane through which fluid and dissolved substances are exchanged with the blood.  Hemodialysis, also spelled haemodialysis, or simply dialysis, is a process of purifying the blood of a person whose kidneys are not working normally.   This reimbursement proposal came from opinions compiled during the past visits to healthcare units treating patients with chronic kidney failure, said Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, in his capacity as the chairman of the NHSB.  Before this endorsed proposal takes effect, those kidney patients choosing HD over PD are normally charged 1,500 baht per time of the kidney dialysis, said Mr Anutin.    After having discussed with Dr Jadej Thammatacharee, secretary-general of the National Health Security Office (NHSO) about the possibility of helping these patients to cope with the financial burden associated with HD, he said, it was concluded that the solution should be to reimburse these patients for their costs of HD.   The reimbursement proposal was based on the Universal Coverage Scheme’s (UCS) core principle -- to as much as possible cover necessary healthcare costs for patients under the UCS in order to save them from plunging into financial difficulties as a result of paying their healthcare costs out of their own pocket, said Dr Jadej.   More importantly, the patient-centred care principle is also adopted in this reimbursement proposal as kidney patients will be allowed to together with their doctors choose the type of renal dialysis most suitable for them considering their financial status, disease and other social factors, he said.   One important factor that also needs to think about when making such a decision is those indirect costs which may come with HD including the cost of travelling regularly to and from a healthcare unit for kidney dialysis.   Aside from proposing to waive the HD fee for these patients, the NHSO also proposed to negotiate with parties concerned for more bargains in the costs of providing HD services in order to keep the costs as low as possible while the UCS has to increase the number of HD units and require more staff as more kidney patients are expected to switch from PD to HD, he said.   An additional mechanism is also required to prevent the number of patients shifting from PD to HD to rise so rapidly that overwhelm the healthcare system, while the work to curb the number of new kidney patients needs to be accelerated, he said.    There currently are 24,256 kidney patients receiving HD whose treatment is paid by the UCS, while the other 6,546 patients aren’t willing to undergo PD and have chosen to pay for the costs of HD by themselves, said Dr Jakkrit Ngowsiri, deputy secretary-general of the NHSO.  Altogether, a total of 30,802 kidney patients are receiving HD under the UCS, while another 32,892 patients do PD, he said.   Of these 32,892 patients undergoing PD, only about 27,958 tend to be willing to continue with PD as the rest are likely to shift to HD later when they will no longer have to pay for the HD fee, he said.   At present, the NHSO reimburses a healthcare unit offering the HD service at 197,700 baht per patient per year, while the cost of PD is 227,300 baht per patient per year, he said. As of now, the total reimbursement for both HD and PD under the UCS is 12.27 billion baht per year, he said.   However, he said, when HD is covered for those patients choosing HD over PD, the total budget required for funding the UCS’ kidney dialysis programme will therefore become 13.41 billion baht per year, a 1.14-billion-baht increase.   However, when the budget already set aside for paying the cost of Erythropoietin (EPO) is deducted from the 1.14-billion-baht increase, the actual extra budget required for funding the HD reimbursement programme will then become 1.07 billion baht, he said.   But since the implementation of this reimbursement programme will run from February until September in this 2022 fiscal year, or in only eight months, the exact additional budget needed will become 719.9 million baht for this fiscal year, he said.   The NHSO, meanwhile, has 968.32 million baht left from the 2021fiscal year, 238.59 million baht of which are set aside for financing the inclusion of new five healthcare benefits into the UCS’s core benefit package, he said.   In this regard, a total of 729.73 million baht are available for use, which is sufficient for funding the 719.9-million-baht increase in funds required in the next eight months for the HD reimbursement programme, he said.   Actually there will still be 9.83 million baht left after the 719.9 million baht is taken, he said.  The main reason that has led the NHSB to approve the proposal to reimburse kidney patients with end-stage renal disease for HD costs is the need to improve flexibility and offer them more choices to choose from in the UCS’ kidney dialysis programme.   The necessity of offering HD to the patients who want it for the sake of maintaining the UCS’s service quality as well as the importance of patient-centred care were also taken into consideration when the NHSB decided on the reimbursement proposal.   Kidney patients will be allowed to, together with their doctors, make the decision as to whether they should go for HD or not.   And to ensure the HD reimbursement programme will be fully funded in the next fiscal year, the NHSO will ensure sufficient budget will be set aside specifically for funding this programme, said Mr Anutin.  The budget diverted to fund the reimbursement programme for kidney patients in the 2022 fiscal year actually was the budget left from the previous fiscal year, he said. ///    "
159,171, More public participation urged in bid to improve UCS’ benefit package   Tue 16 November 2021  ,"          More public participation urged in bid to improve UCS’ benefit package   About 18 years ago the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS), also known as the Bt30 for all treatment programme or the Gold Card programme, was more often referred to in some sarcastic jokes as being either the “Bt30 programme in which you will end up dying as a result of just any diseases” or the “healthcare programme in which you will only get paracetamol in every visit to the hospital”. To be fair, that was around the beginning of the healthcare scheme when it still didn’t cover treatment for as many as diseases as it does now.  Over time the benefit package of the UCS has vastly improved until it has now become more or less equivalent to that of other healthcare schemes, namely Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme (CSMBS) and the Social Security Scheme (SSS).  The key to success in the continuous improvement of the UCS’ benefit package is public participation in proposing as to what else should be included into the package. These proposals are compiled and then forwarded to the National Health Security Committee (NHSC) for approval. Several communication channels have been designed for gathering public opinions about the benefit package of the UCS, including public hearings and the National Health Security Office’s (NHSO) Hotline No.1330. Most recently the NHSO had on Nov 1 began allowing members of the public to submit their opinions about their ideal benefit package of the UCS via the website https://ucbp.nhso.go.th. This way they can also track progress of their submissions online.  Many people tend to think that giving an opinion on the improvement of the UCS’ benefit package is a privilege of only those with an important role, while in reality just everyone has the right to have their voice heard in this process. All they have to do is research for some information to support their proposals.    Voramon Agrasuta, a dentist with the Ministry of Public Health, shared her experience in taking part in the past revisions of the UCS’ benefit package. Previously when she worked at a district hospital, she simply thought many more dental care services should be included into the UCS’ benefit package.   She later discovered that she could also contribute to a revision of the benefit package after she had moved to work at the Bureau of Dental Health of the Department of Health.  She has proposed to include, for instance, an oral health check-up for the working age and the elderly and screening for signs of oral cancer. These proposals of her have been taken seriously, some of which are in lined to be forwarded to the NHSC for endorsement.  “Oral health check-ups for people in the working age and the elderly may seem to be a basic dental care service; but in reality it is still not covered under the UCS,” she said.  Screening for signs of oral cancer is also very important especially in the people aged 40 and over as their risk of developing this type of cancer usually becomes higher as they become older, she said. From her experience, Ms Voramon now realises it is not as difficult as she previously thought to succeed in proposing changes to the UCS’ benefit package.   As the NHSO now receives proposals through various channels, its academic section assure members of the public who are interested in proposing changes to the UCS’ benefit package that all they have to do is communicate clearly as to what they expect from a new revision of the healthcare benefit package. The section will then find academic information to support their ideas for them.    Assoc Prof Dr Abhasnee Sobhonslidsuki, another person with experience in proposing changes to the UCS’ benefit package, said when she began serving as the secretary-general of the Thai Association for the Study of the Liver (THASL) in 2017 she became to realise that the costly liver transplant, crucial for saving more than 200 lives of the people waiting for the transplant each year, should be covered under the UCS.  She had therefore proposed for the UCS to include the liver transplant into its benefit package, which had in January this year been eventually endorsed.  The key to success in winning approval for her suggested change to the UCS’ benefit package is that first of all the importance of the proposed change needs to be underlined, she said.  In this case, she said, a high number of cirrhosis patients needing a liver transplant, the high mortality rate of the liver disease and high medical treatment costs if these patients are left without the life-saving medical intervention strongly supported her proposal and helped it win the cost-benefit analysis.   “It’s important for anyone who aims to propose such a change to research into and evaluate his or her idea in order to gather information and data to support it,” she said.   Phlainaphat Chomdaeng is one of young patients who have undergone a liver transplant under the UCS. When she was two months old she had yellowing of the whites of the eyes (sclera) and skin (jaundice), which are common symptoms of cirrhosis, said the girl’s mother.  The mother had therefore researched over the internet and found information about Ramathibodi Hospital’s liver transplant programme. The girl underwent the liver transplant in 2011, one year after preparing for the operation. “At first, I was so worried about the extremely high cost of the transplant that I gave up on the idea of seeking the operation,” she said. “But later when I found out that the transplant is covered under the UCS, I’ve become so grateful for both Ramathibodi and the NHSO for saving my daughter’s life.”   Thanaphon Dokkaeo who was in 2003 diagnosed with end-stage rental failure, stemmed mainly from high blood pressure, said his hypertension had been left untreated for a long time because he couldn’t afford his health care costs before the UCS came.   “The 2002 Health Security Act didn’t cover high-cost treatment, which was back then a nightmare to patients with kidney failure,” he said. “It was like a death sentence back then and all you could do was said good bye to your families.”  The costs of treatment were extremely high while the number of healthcare units and staff capable of performing kidney dialysis was extremely limited, he said.  Currently more than 95% of the people with end-stage rental failure have sufficient access to kidney dialysis, kidney transplant service and immunosuppressants under the UCS, he said.  “I’d like to thank the NHSO for listening to opinions from the people and annually gathering their opinions as input to the annual revision of the UCS’ benefit package.

161,174," Better COVID-19 care, more healthcare benefits to be covered by UCS in 2022 fiscal year   Fri 08 October 2021  ","     Better COVID-19 care, more healthcare benefits to be covered by UCS    in 2022 fiscal year              As COVID-19 remains a major health threat in Thailand, the National Health Security Office (NHSO) has committed to financially supporting the country’s healthcare system to cope better with the coronavirus outbreak, from screening to treatment.              At the same time, the NHSO will continue improving the healthcare coverage and the quality of services offered under the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS), also known as the “Gold Card” programme.              The NHSO now is confident the UCS’ benefit package that will be adjusted in the 2022 fiscal year, starting October 1, 2021, will address all healthcare needs in the country’s ongoing battle against COVID-19 and effort to live with it for at least another year, said Dr Jadej Thammatacharee, sSecretary-gGeneral of the NHSO.                                                                Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul had, in his capacity as the chairman of the National Health Security Board (NHSB), on September 9, 2021 signed the NHSB’s announcements on rules and regulations concerning the management of the National Health Security Fund (NHSF) in the 2022 fiscal year and the reimbursement to healthcare providers for their service delivered under the UCS in 2021.          In total 198.89 billion baht have been set aside for funding the UCS’ operations, excluding the about 140.55 billion baht earmarked separately for paying as salaries to staff at state-run healthcare units taking part in the UCS.               Dr Jadej said the core principle in managing the NHSF is to provide as many healthcare benefits as possible to the people who may become financially insecure if they pay for the costs of essential healthcare on their own.            The 2022 budget will be rearranged in order to cope better with changes in the country’s health situation, he said.            In the area of health and disease prevention, for instance, it is in the 2022 fiscal year clearly indicated for the first time that the right to receive services in this specific area of healthcare under the UCS belongs to every Thai citizen, he said.             Prenatal care will be provided free of charge to all, not only the people registered under the UCS as in the past, he said.            Pregnant women who are registered under the Social Security Scheme (SSS) will even be able to choose to receive prenatal care at healthcare units they normally receive other services under the SSS, while the NHSO will take care of reimbursing the costs of the prenatal care service for those SSS care providers, he said.             The fund of about 2.8 billion baht earmarked for financing health promotion and prevention at the area level will in this new fiscal year be allocated directly to more than 7,000 local administrative organisations nationwide, he said, adding that this type of funds was previously included into the capitation budget.            As for new health benefits that will be included into the core benefit package of the UCS in this fiscal year, oral cancer screening will be one of them, he said, adding that patients will be screened for oral cancer when visiting a dentist for dental care.            Minimally Iinvasive Ssurgery or MIS, in which patients can go home in the same day of the operation or rest in the hospital for only one day and will be then discharged the following day, will also be covered by the UCS for various treatments, he said.            They will possibly include laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery to examine the digestive system, minimally invasive surgery to inspect the gall bladder, laparoscopic surgery to correct a ruptured eardrum, laparoscopy to inject substances to treat inflammation of vocal cords, and laparoscopic surgery to insert dialysis catheters for kidney patients, he said.            When these surgery procedures are included into the UCS’ benefit package, care providers will be given incentive to try shortening, where appropriate, the period of time each patient needs to stay in the hospital after in-patient treatment, which in a way comes with a higher risk of contracting other diseases such as COVID-19.            Public access to the rapid antigen test kit for COVID-19 and the standard test for the coronavirus infection, which are crucial for detecting new infections, will improve greatly in this new fiscal year, so will support for the home and community-based care for people infected with the virus and the care along with financial assistance for the people suffering unwanted side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine being offered under the government’s vaccination drive, he said.               In the past the longer the hospital kept a UCS patient, the more money they got paid from the healthcare scheme for its service, he said.            In diabetes care, the NHSO will focus more on young patients with diabetes or ones who need to depend more on insulin injection, he said.            Blood sugar test kits and portable blood sugar monitors will be provided to them to help these patients keep track of their glucose levels at home, he said.            In cancer care, more cancer drugs and other related medical supplies will be covered if approved by a panel of cancer treatment experts who will also be tasked with inspecting the treatment standards of medical institutions taking part in the UCS’ universal cancer treatment programme, he said.            Several new health benefits that will be added to the UCS’ core benefit package are costly yet necessary, for the sake of ensuring patients’ access to essential treatments, he said.            "

163,178, Chonburi nursing students’ first-hand experience in helping COVID-19 home isolation patients   Fri 20 August 2021  ,"   Chonburi nursing students’ first-hand experience in helping COVID-19 home isolation patients               Chanapha Saenloet, a fourth-year student at Borommarajonani College of Nursing in Chonburi province, at first hesitated to apply to volunteer to help COVID-19 patients in home isolation when she was informed about the volunteer opportunity.             For a moment she wasn’t confident in her ability to answer all questions the patients may ask her when she called them to check and assess their condition. Neither was she certain if she would really be able to help them gain access to the healthcare services they may request.             But after an online briefing conducted via Zoom by a team from the National Health Security Office (NHSO), she gained more confidence and was convinced she could and should do the volunteer work.             She has then become one of the 154 nursing students from the same nursing college to volunteer with the NHSO Region 6 in Rayong helping handle COVID-19 patients who are under home isolation in the eastern provinces.             On Aug 9, 2021, when she began taking part in the volunteer work programme, it really warmed her heart when she called her first few patients and learned that she was the first to contact and help them with coordinating the delivery of necessary medications to them.             Of course, some of the patients vented on her about their frustrations over problems in the Home Isolation programme such as that the NHSO’s hotline No.1330 appeared to always be busy especially when they really needed help.             She dealt with such a situation by listening attentively to their complaints and trying to explain to those frustrated patients as much as she could the actual situation facing the NHSO’s hotline service. And when it came to questions, she couldn’t really answer, she asked a support team from the NHSO such as when she received a request for a lung X-ray service and information as to where COVID-19 testing services could be sought.             “Is it a lot of pressure to deal with? Honestly, yes. It’s sometimes. But we always have those senior staff members from the NHSO to support us,” said the nursing student.             About 7pm of every day, she and other volunteers and the NHSO staff in the same team have review and discussions about the work they have done at the end of the day, to see how they could improve their service.                       “Although I may be only a small part of the team, I’m now very proud of what I am doing. We help COVID-19 infected patients and there actually are more people who still are waiting for us to help them,” she said.               Phanitnan Nuanchan, another four-year nursing student from the same college, shared the same pride of becoming a part of the volunteer work for COVID-19 patients in home isolation in the eastern provinces, where the number of new COVID-19 infections was rising.             She said she now has an opportunity to put her nursing skills into good use. She at least could help assure these patients that they were receiving proper care, which helped relieve their stress associated with their infection.             “I’m happy to be a part of this effort to help the people during this COVID-19 crisis,” she said.              Under this cooperation between the college and the NHSO Region 6, these volunteering nursing students are joining the NHSO teams in providing COVID-19 patients some advice and assess their symptoms through a telephone call, said Sukjai Charoensuk, the director of Borommarajonani College of Nursing, Chonburi.             And in case any patients tend to need to be admitted to a hospital for medical treatment, these volunteers are also responsible for coordinating the transfer of them to the hospital, she said.             Working together with the NHSO Region 6, the college has integrated Primary Medical Care, a subject its fourth-year students are studying, into the NHSO’s Home Isolation programme for COVID-19 patients, she said.             The subject deals with nursing skills ranging from how to conduct a physical examination on patients to how to provide them with primary care, she said.             Starting Aug 9, 2021, a total of 100 mobile phones are provided to these volunteering students for calling patients in home isolation on a daily basis. And with these 154 nursing students joining the NHSO, they altogether are capable of calling more than 1,000 patients a day.             “We started out with these fourth-year students because they are most ready to perform the task. And next we will evaluate the programme in two weeks to see if it will be possible to allow second- and third-year students to join it as well,” she said.             Moreover, as a number of enquiries have been received recently from general volunteers who also would like to take part in this programme, the college and the NHSO are looking into the possibility of allowing the people who have not been trained in nursing or medicine to also volunteer with this programme in the future.             As for the fourth-year nursing students now doing this volunteer work, she said, aside from having an opportunity to do good deeds, they will also benefit from learning about updates on this emerging disease, how the country’s healthcare system actually works from the primary care level to the tertiary level, and roles of tele-health and tele-medicine.             More importantly, volunteering with the COVID-19 home isolation programme also comes as an important opportunity for these nursing students to practice their communication skills, which will prepare them for their work after graduation, she said.             “They will also have a chance to learn from this volunteer work how important and practical holistic care is in real life,” she said.              The volunteer programme will continue until the outbreak situation subsides, she said. The college will find more volunteers to supply to the programme when this batch of nursing students graduates, she said.             With between 300 and 1,000 patients to look after under COVID-19 home isolation, each team of nursing students are at the moment assigned to handle between 30 and 40 patients per day, while a total of five support teams from the NHSO Region 6 work to back them up, said Visit Yeesunthong, the director of the NHSO Region 6 Rayong              In the future, these volunteering nursing students may also be assigned to handle other groups of patients in communities who have trouble visiting doctors during the COVID-19 outbreak such as patients with diabetes and hypertension, said Mr Visit.

164,179," More clinics join forces with NHSO to expand COVID-19 care for patients at home, in communities   Wed 11 August 2021  ","   More clinics join forces with NHSO to expand COVID-19 care for patients at home, in communities              Before joining the National Health Security Office’s (NHSO) Home Isolation and Community Isolation system on July 12, 2021, Ramintra Health Sanaclinic, a medical clinic in Khan Na Yao district of Bangkok, has already been taking part in an initiative to reach out to the people infected with the novel coronavirus and left without access to proper healthcare.             The clinic has been volunteering with a group of healthcare workers running a Facebook page called Rao Tong Rot (We will survive). The group consists of a number of medical doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers who try whatever they can to relieve difficulties facing COVID-19 infected patients who are unable to gain access to healthcare.             And when asked by the NHSO to become a part of its Home Isolation and Community Isolation system, the medical clinic that is already a member of the NHSO’s primary care network in Bangkok didn’t hesitate to say “yes”.                    In the beginning, the clinic is capable of taking care of only 16 patients at a time; but it expects to keep expanding its capacity until it can handle up to a hundred COVID-19 patients in the Home Isolation and Community Isolation system, said Nunthasak Sookhkaew, a dentist who is the operator of the clinic.             “We’re glad to join hands with the NHSO to take care of COVID-19 patients at home, which is a very good policy to cope with the outbreak situation,” he said. “I think all other healthcare providers should join this effort to help the affected people.”               Aside from providing those patients with a set of a thermometer, fingertip pulse oximeter and medications and delivering to them three meals a day, the clinic give them a follow-up video call twice a day, said Dr Piyapong Suvansanya, the medical director of Ramintra Health Sahaclinic.              The regular video calling is not only for checking on the patients’ condition but also for assuring them that they currently are in a proper healthcare system, he said, adding that the caller can also provide suitable advice when knowing the actual health situation of these patients.             In case their symptoms are exacerbated by such as lung infection even while on favipiravir supplied by the NHSO, the clinic will immediately contact Nopparat Rajathanee Hospital and coordinate the transfer of the patients to the private hospital for treatment, he said.             The 1,000 baht imbursement for arranging three meals per patient per day is sufficient and the clinic has no trouble delivering them to the patients under its care at all as delivering food to COVID-19 patients is also part of its voluntary work, said Mr Nunthasak.             As for the 1,100 baht reimbursement for providing a thermometer and a fingertip pulse oximeter per patient, the clinic actually pays more than the given rate, he said. After all that is not actually a problem because the clinic is willing to help support the NHSO’s effort to help COVID-19 patients.             The NHSO’s supplying of favipiravir, in particular, helps the clinic cope better with patients who go into COVID-19 isolation at home when they only have mild symptoms but may later develop moderate symptoms, he said.             “Since July 12, we’re so happy to become a part of the Home Isolation and Community Isolation system of the NHSO that helps improve public access to necessary healthcare,” he said.             The provision of COVID-19 antigen test kits has also been very helpful when it comes to active case finding, he said.             The rapid test kits are used for screening the people to see who actually need to undergo a RT-PCR test to confirm if they are infected with the virus or not, he said.               The NHSO along with Department of Medical Services has developed a guideline for properly reimbursing primary care providers for their services being offered to COVID-19 patients while waiting at home or in a community for their turns to be admitted to a hospital or a field hospital for treatment, said Dr Athaporn Limpanyalers, deputy secretary-general of the NHSO.             “The NHSO would like to thank Ramintra Health Sahaclinic and all other clinics that are taking part in this at-home COVID-19 care system. We do need cooperation from all sides to reach out to all infected patients during this crisis,” he said.             Dr Pattarapan Sakda, the owner of another medical clinic that now takes part in the COVID-19 care system, said since joining the Home Isolation and Community Isolation programme on July 19, 2021, his clinic has been taking care of about 160 patients.             Every day about 20 new COVID-19 patients contact the clinic and request to receive care under the Home Isolation programme, said the doctor.             the Home Isolation and Community Isolation system was designed by the Department of Medical Services as a mechanism to turn houses and communities virtually into hospitals which are equipped with necessary medical devices, medications, food and doctors, said Dr Jadej Thammatacharee, secretary-general of the NHSO.             A number of factors are normally taken into consideration as to which homes or communities are suitable for taking part in this COVID-19 care system, he said.             First, the condition of the patient determines whether he or she is suitable for receiving at-home COVID-19 care and only an infected person with no or mild symptoms should receive care at home.             Second, the condition of the patient’s home should also be totally suitable for COVID-19 isolation. It should have a separate bed room for each infected person. A place where two to three infected people sleep in the same room is not suitable for home isolation.             Third, the COVID-19 patient’s understanding and cooperation are also a key factor when assessing if he or she should be included into the Home Isolation and Community Isolation programme.             And lastly, the other important factor is the concerned hospital’s readiness for arranging a proper healthcare setting, in which a medical doctor is available to make a regular video call to home isolation patients and  thermometers, fingertip pulse oximeters, and three meals a day are delivered to them as well.   “Because the COVID-19 situation changes constantly and fast, we have to work faster,” said Dr Jadej.

165,181," Home Isolation, Community Isolation, aimed at curbing COVID-19 deaths and new infections in Thailand   Fri 30 July 2021  ","   Home Isolation, Community Isolation, aimed at curbing COVID-19 deaths and new infections in Thailand  Nittaya Phanuphak, MD, PhD Executive Director   Institute of HIV Research and Innovation (IHRI)             Over the past week, the terms Home Isolation and Community Isolation have been mentioned very often and become familiar to many, as they were adopted as new key strategies to cope with the surge in number of new COVID-19 cases. Hospitals, field hospitals and hospitels are now being overwhelmed by the rapid rise in new infections, while the need to prevent infected people from developing severe symptoms of the disease or dying remains. So does the need to bring down the number of new infections in communities.             On the surface, the Home Isolation and Community Isolation processes appear to be easy tasks that require a similar approach to manage as in the better known telehealth service, which has been adopted in the previous waves of COVID-19. But in reality, there are several aspects of Home Isolation and Community Isolation and factors to ponder before implementing them. Among these aspects and factors are the condition of the house, the number of people living in it, how much the other members of the community agree with these forms of the COVID-19 isolation in their community, the ability of the community or the healthcare provider concerned to take care of the patients who will also need to be supplied with three meals a day, stigma attached to COVID-19 infection, discrimination against infected people, the risk of their rights being violated and stress associated with the infection. So, this is not simply arranging the telehealth service for the people who have to go into isolation at home or in a community.             In this regard, the team providing Home Isolation and Community Isolation services should consist of members from various disciplines including the infected people themselves, their families, community leaders, nurses and doctors. Policy makers of the country, meanwhile, have to listen to opinions of and respect and trust all parties in the team. The policy makers also need to improve public understanding of the goal and importance of Home Isolation and Community Isolation as well as roles of the individuals in these COVID-19 isolation formats. The government also needs to plan and invest in bolstering public confidence in these isolations programmes and enhancing the people’s ability to become a part of the programmes, in order to prevent miscommunication that may result from different political preferences and concern among certain experts.             Effective cooperation among interdisciplinary parties in creating a good standard of both Home Isolation and Community Isolation is also crucial for assuring the infected people and their families they will definitely receive good and standard holistic care at home or in the community, although they may not be able to be admitted to the hospital for treatment just yet. The standard of Home Isolation and Community Isolation must be in line with the National Health Security Office’s reimbursement regulations and a guideline on COVID-19 treatment and care by the Department of Medical Services. And it is equally important to assure healthcare providers in the community, at medical clinics and in hospitals what they are doing are actually subject to daily adjustment to keep up with the changing situation of the COVID-19 outbreak in the country and that they will totally be finally supported. They need to be assured also that sufficient funds are earmarked for financing the provision of these COVID-19 isolation services and mechanism to prevent corruption and the misuse of these funds and medical supplies provided are being implemented all along. More importantly, These healthcare providers need to be assured that they won’t later end up facing an investigation or criticism, in which they will likely be judged as if they work in a normal situation. They shouldn’t be ordered, when the public health crisis has ended, to return the money paid to them for providing the isolation service as a result of such an investigation either.             Prompt provision of healthcare at home or in the community to COVID-19 infected patients who only have asymptomatic and mild symptoms of the disease (Green Group) as soon as they are confirmed to have the virus is important. So is constant follow-up care by the people in the same house or community and nurses and medical doctors who provide them the telehealth service. These elements are crucial for assuring the infected patients that they will promptly receive favipiravir when signs of lung infection emerge. Patients with moderate (Yellow Group) and severe (Red Group) symptoms are also assured they will receive favipiravir treatment to keep the lung infection at bay and other treatment to control other symptoms if they really still have to wait for a hospital bed. These are all aimed at “mitigating the severity of COVID-19 infection and reducing the number of fatalities”.              As for the need to “curb the number of new infections in the community as fast as possible”, a key factor is how well an infected person is isolated from the rest of the family or housemates during Home Isolation or Community Isolation. Both infected people and the other people living in the same house or community require not only knowledge about effective COVID-19 isolation but also other forms of support including three meals a day. Other types of support they may also need include other basic necessities in case the infected people are ones who normally work to financially support their families. They will also need help with disinfecting their houses and household utensils. Sometimes, they may also need help with improving understanding among their neighbours and dealing with the parties that violate their rights such as the media, their employers or their schools. These are all required to ensure the COVID-19 isolation at home or in the community is conducted properly and not impacted by social and economic factors. Aside from preventing infected people from spreading the virus to others in the family or community, active case finding is also important for curbing the number of new infections and needs to be carried out all along. Contacts of a confirmed COVID-19 case need to be sorted into groups concerning levels of their risk of contracting the virus and go into isolation as well. Prioritising as to who should get vaccinated against COVID-19 first and later in the communities with a serious outbreak situation is also important for containing the spread of the virus.               Since Home Isolation and Community Isolation now undeniably concern everyone in some ways, aside from understanding them we may also help further by spreading the knowledge about these two types of COVID-19 isolation to others to improve public understanding about them. Some may produce content for publishing on various media platforms to educate various groups of people about the procedure of Home Isolation and Community Isolation, while others may help prepare meals for supplying to the infected people in isolation or transporting thermometers, pulse oximeters and medications to the infected patients. As for those who may not be able to get involved in the afore-mentioned voluntary activities, they may choose to donate money for purchasing more of such medical devices instead. And for the people who understand the languages used by migrant workers in Thailand, they can also help by simply volunteering as interpreters for healthcare workers when it comes communicating with migrant workers.             Last but not least, I strongly believe everyone can help make the country’s implementation of Home Isolation and Community Isolation a good quality service with flexibility and maximum participation by communities. In conclusion, Home Isolation and Community Isolation both consist of four key elements, namely public and community preparation, prompt provision of care and treatment to COVID-19 infected patients, fast and effective searches for contacts of infected people, and improving access to the COVID-19 vaccination. These will gradually improve the hospital bed shortage situation and we will soon see a drop in the number of COVID-19 deaths and new infections.    "
166,183, Home isolation improves healthcare resource management: A case study of Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Hospital   Fri 23 July 2021  ,"   Home isolation improves healthcare resource management: A case study of Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Hospital             Home isolation program for COVID-19 patients with asymptomatic or mild symptoms helps hospitals manage their resources more effectively while ensuring access to hospital beds for critical cases.                   Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Hospital, a regional hospital operated under the Public Health Ministry, is one of many hospitals introducing home isolation programs to coronavirus patients.  Dr Saowalak Chawpontong, an assistant to the hospital’s director, said that the hospital beds had been full because of the recent surge of cases.             This week, the number of new cases in Thailand surpasses 10,000 by the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant.              The discovery of more new cases is also a result of the Public Health Ministry’s approval for the use of antigen test kits in early July, increasing people’s access to COVID-19 tests.              Testing patients with antigen test kits, Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Hospital’s staff finds around 30 new cases each day. Though a field hospital was set up for new cases, said Dr Saowalak, it was full within one day.             To cope with the brimful bed capacity, the hospital staff must initiate the home isolation program for the patients with asymptomatic or mild symptoms, account for 80% of COVID-19 cases.               Patients will receive medicines, meals, aid packages, thermometers, and finger oxygen meters while being isolated at home.             They must measure their temperature and oxygen level, then send the results to hospital staff via Line chat twice a day. Each of them must also fill up a symptom reporting form.              Their information is linked to the hospital database that classifies patients based on the severity level of their symptoms, helping hospital staff notice the patients with worsening conditions and find hospital beds for them.             It also uses COVID Tracker, a telemedicine software developed by Precision Dietz Co. Ltd., to communicate with the patients regularly.              Around 100 cases are under Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Hospital’s home isolation program recently. The program allows the hospital to reserve hospital beds for critical patients requiring intensive care while increasing their chances of survival.              As treating patients at home is new to Thai society, Dr Saowalak said it was crucial to collaborate with family doctors at community clinics to educate people about the necessity and benefit of a home isolation program during the pandemic.                “To achieve a home isolation program, the strength of primary care is vital,” she said. She added that her hospital staff was planning to run a community isolation program for the patients whose houses’ environment can’t support home isolation.              The program, led by a local administrative organization in collaboration with the district office, involves setting up and managing the community’s isolation facilities.              The hospital staff will provide patients medical supplies and virtual consultants with doctors.     "
167,185," Prompt no-fault compensation for post-jab adverse events raises confidence, speeds up country’s bid to reach herd immunity against COVID-19   Tue 06 July 2021  ","   Prompt no-fault compensation for post-jab adverse events raises confidence, speeds up country’s bid to reach herd immunity against COVID-19    Anutin Charnvirakul Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister   Information compiled from injections of more than a hundred million doses of COVID-19 vaccines carried out around the world has shown side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine and adverse events following vaccination are extremely rare. The fact is some people may still experience some side effects of any vaccines sometimes, even after they are fully developed and no matter what companies they belong to. All COVID-19 vaccines being used now, meanwhile, still are approved for emergency use only.           Public confidence in the safety of COVID-19 vaccines continues to be undermined by news reports about side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine and suspected adverse events after vaccination, ranging from mild ones – such as dizziness, vomiting, fevers, numbness, and weakness in legs or arms – to serious ones – such as permanent unconsciousness and death. That’s the reason why it is crucial to keep boosting public confidence in the government’s COVID-19 vaccination programme that will not only help mitigate the severity of the disease but also build up heard immunity for the entire country when at least 70% of the entire population is fully vaccinated.   “Side effects of COVID-19 vaccines are something we can never deny. And that is why all vaccine recipients are required to stay half an hour longer for observation of possible side effects that normally occur within this period of time. And this should improve public confidence in the vaccination programme to some extent.”           In case of COVID-19 vaccine’s side effects and adverse events following vaccination, the National Health Security Office (NHSO) is offering financial compensation as preliminary assistance to parties suffering these unwanted consequences of the COVID-19 vaccination. The compensation is now allowed under Section 41 of the 2002 National Health Security Act, which normally deals with preliminary assistance for parties suffering health damages following a healthcare service received under the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS). Prior to the launch of the financial compensation for COVID-19 vaccine recipients, additional rules were issued to specify terms and conditions of the financial compensation programme that will offer parties suffering a significant health condition suspected to have been caused by the COVID-19 vaccination.           This is a social mechanism to provide preliminary assistance to help alleviate suffering without having to wait until final results of a medical investigation are known. Anyone who has recently been injected with a COVID-19 vaccine and afterwards developed any health conditions suspected to be linked to the given vaccine has every right to believe these conditions may have been caused by the vaccine. And this is consistent with a medical point of view that these COVID-19 vaccines may still have some side effects while still being approved for emergency use only. The real cause of the suspected health conditions will later be proved in a formal medical investigation.           The process of seeking this preliminary financial assistance isn’t complicated at all. In case of death after COVID-19 vaccination, for instance, a relative of the death may submit a request for the financial compensation to either the hospital at where the vaccination in question was carried out, the Provincial Public Health Office, or a branch office of the NHSO closet to him or her. Other channels for submitting the request include health volunteers or an independent unit receiving complaints, which is authorisied by the power of Section 50(5) of the 2002 National Health Security Act. The NHSO has already appointed a sub-committee tasked with handling these requests in all 13 health regions. Each of these sub-committees consists of a sufficient number of medical experts who will examine and decide as to which case is justified to receive the financial compensation. The sub-committees will basically base their judgement on the patient’s medical history.           So, every case suspected to be linked to the COVID-19 vaccination should be immediately submitted to the compensation sub-committee for consideration. And in case the sub-committee agrees the case deserves to be compensated for, the financial compensation will normally be paid by the NHSO within five days after that. The money will be transferred to bank account given by to the party concerned. And even if it is later proved in a formal medical investigation to have nothing to do with the COVID-19 vaccination as suspected in the beginning, the money already paid won’t be recalled. The reason is this money is simply intended as preliminary assistance in the no-fault compensation programme.           “Now a total of 344 requests for compensation have been received and the NHSO already has paid the compensation in 239 cases totaling 3.01 million baht (as of June 4, 2021). Most of these cases dealt with mild symptoms that occurred after the vaccination such as numbness. And of all six requests for compensation in case of post-jab death, four have so far been compensated for, which were in Pathum Thani, Songkhla, Phrae and Tak.”           The no-fault compensation idea has been recognised worldwide for its benefits for and protection of vaccine recipients as well as its providing of incentive for more people to come forward to receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.           In March, 2021 the World Health Organization (WHO) has launched an international compensation programme, which WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said was intended for easing suffering by those affected by the COVID-19 vaccination, without having to go the court to demand for compensation.           The no-fault compensation idea isn’t actually new as about 25 member countries of all 194 WHO member nations, including Thailand, have already brought in place a similar no-fault compensation programme for any damages in medical and healthcare services in general.           This is a proof that Thailand is now on the right track in its efforts to build up immunity against COVID-19 as a way of surviving the COVID-19 crisis.      "
168,186, NHSO offers no-fault compensation for vaccination’s adverse events   Thu 24 June 2021  ,"   NHSO offers no-fault compensation for vaccination’s adverse events   The core principle of the National Health Security Office’s (NHSO) current provision of preliminary financial assistance to people suffering adverse events following COVID-19 vaccinations is it is a no-fault compensation programme.   This means affected parties will promptly receive the compensation without having to wait until results of a formal investigation into any such suspected vaccination adverse events are known.   From its point of view, the NHSO believes any delays in getting help to the people who are affected by adverse events after vaccination are equivalent to exacerbating the problems they are suffering and trying to cope with.   The financial compensation sub-committee usually processes requests for compensation as soon as possible, while the rates of the financial compensation are the same as those rates set under Section 41 of the 2002 National Health Security Act for adverse events in healthcare under the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS).   A specific announcement, however, was issued by the National Health Security Board (NHSB) to include also vaccine recipients who are under the Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme (CSMBS) and the Social Security System (SSS).   When approved by the sub-committee, the compensation payment is required to be done within five days afterwards.     These are all in the policy set by Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul in his capacity as the chairman of the NHSB who is determined to improve public confidence in the government’s COVID-19 mass vaccination programme.   “Despite having an extremely low rate of adverse events after vaccination, the COVID-19 vaccines still are approved for emergency use only, which means there will likely be unwanted side effects as even those completely developed vaccines still have some side effects,” said Mr Anutin.   “The government has therefore aimed to assure members of the public that in case any of them suffers such side effects of the vaccine, he or she will promptly be compensated for,” he said.   After all, the data collected from injections of more than 100 shots of COVID-19 vaccines around the world showed side effects of these vaccines occurred at an extremely low rate, especially when compared with the risk of contracting COVID-19 if not vaccinated, said Mr Anutin.   That explains why every country has resolved to use the COVID-19 vaccine as a defence against the outbreak, he said.   “We can’t say there won’t be any side effects or adverse events after vaccination. But we can assure that these side effects and adverse events will be manageable and can be mitigated,” he said.   As the chairman of the NHSB, Mr Anutin insists the financial compensation will be paid without having to wait until the suspected vaccine side effects or vaccination adverse events are proved.   Even though these illnesses, injuries or deaths are later proved to have nothing to do with the COVID-19 vaccine injected, the compensation that was already paid won’t be recalled, he said.   The NHSO now has all 13 sub-committees, consisting of a sufficient number of medical experts, to promptly handle requests for the compensation, he said.   “We are ready to get the compensation payment done as soon as the sub-committee approves it,” he said.   The compensation rates are divided into three categories, namely at most 100,000 baht for a persistent injury or illness, at most 240,000 baht for losses of body parts or disabilities, and at most 400,000 baht for death or permanent disabilities.   The no-fault compensation idea has won international recognition for its benefits in terms of offering protection and remedies to vaccine recipients and encouragement for more people to get vaccinated.   The World Health Organization (WHO) has in March, 2021 implemented an international programme of no-fault compensation for people suffering adverse events after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.     WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said this programme will help ease a burden facing people who suffer these vaccination adverse events as they won’t have to struggle to have their cases proved in court to demand financial compensation.   At least 25 out of all 194 member countries of the WHO are implementing a similar no-fault compensation programme, not only for people who suffer unwanted consequences of COVID-19 vaccination but also for ones suffering any other adverse events in healthcare.   Without having to wait for results of a formal investigation into a suspected case of adverse events in COVID-19 vaccination, affected parties will receive help in a timely manner and the damage will therefore be limited.   Details of the compensation programme vary from country to country such as where funds are from and who is in charge of the implementation of the programme.     Any suspected cases of such unwanted side effects or Organization (WHO)should be submitted to the NHSO for consideration, said Dr Jadej Thammatach-aree, secretary-general of the NHSO.   These cases are received through three channels, namely the hospital or the vaccination venue where vaccinations in question were conducted, the provincial public health office and the NHSO’s branch offices in any of the 13 health regions across the country, he said.   Only the national ID number, the name of the vaccination venue, the number of bank account are required to be filled in the compensation request form before submission, he said.   “We also want to know what side effects the COVID-19 vaccine may actually have in a real-world situation. If you don’t tell us, we will never know and keep assuming the vaccine is safe,” he said.   The information received from vaccine recipients will be compiled and reported to companies producing these vaccines for future improvement as well, he said.     Asst Prof Dr Surat Tanprawate, an expert on the neurological system and brain with the Neurological Society of Thailand who is a member of the sub-committee handling suspected cases of COVID-19 vaccine side effects and vaccination adverse events in the 1st Health Region in Chiang Mai has revealed that the sub-committee had approved the full payment of 400,000 baht to the family of Udon Yenchit, a village head in Phrae province who had died after receiving a shot of the COVID-19 vaccine.   Although the actual cause of death in this case still could not be confirmed at this point, the sub-committee has agreed that the preliminary financial assistance should be provided to the family of the dead person because the death had occurred during a time close to the COVID-19 vaccination, he said.   “The NSHO aims to ease as much as possible suffering encountering recipients of the COVID-19 vaccine, without having to wait for results of a formal investigation,” he said.    "
169,188, Any suspected symptoms deserve attention until actually ruled out: Dr Jadej   Mon 14 June 2021  ,"   Any suspected symptoms deserve attention until actually ruled out: Dr Jadej   Confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine remains thin in the air. Any time news breaks about a fresh case of suspected adverse reactions or side effects of the vaccine being experienced by someone, the already low public confidence is shattered even more.   And despite an assertion by the National Health Security Board that all COVID-19 vaccine recipients will be taken good care of and compensated for in the event of them encountering adverse events after vaccination, a lot of questions have arisen over the financial compensation programme for people suffering serious enough side effects of the vaccine.   Dr Jadej Thammatach-aree, Secretary-General of the National Health Security Office (NHSO), has therefore offered in a recent interview clarification of terms and conditions of the compensation programme.   Basically, vaccine recipients should never decide on their own whether symptoms they are experiencing after vaccination are side effects of the vaccine or not, said Dr Jadej.   Instead they should notify the NHSO about these symptoms and the NHSO’s sub-committee responsible for processing a request for financial compensation in each health region, comprising a sufficient number of medical experts, will decide on the request, he said.   And if the sub-committee agrees that the case should be compensated for, the compensation will be then paid within five working days, he said.   All suspected cases should be first assumed to be true    The fact is these COVID-19 vaccines are currently approved for emergency use only, which means some side effects of them will possibly be experienced by a number of vaccine recipients, he said.   Even those vaccines fully developed may still have some side effects and are not totally safe, he said.   After all, the risk of suffering side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines cannot compare with the risk of developing severe or deadly symptoms as a result of contracting the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, he said citing the data collected from more than 100 million injections of the vaccines worldwide.   “We can’t say there aren’t any such side effects. But several side effects can actually be mitigated or cured [if a medical intervention is performed in time],” he said.   That explains why all vaccine recipients are advised to remain at the vaccination venue for about half an hour after vaccination for observation of possible side effects of the vaccine that usually occur in the first 30 minutes after injection, he said.   Especially in case of death that follows a recent COVID-19 vaccination, he said, the death should be first assumed to be a result of the vaccination, considering that the vaccine has been approved for emergency use only.   “I believe every medical doctor should first bear in mind such a death may have something to do with the vaccine injected and then continue proving until it is clearly known if it was the vaccine or not that caused the death,” he said.   So, personally, he said, he was wondering why some medical doctors were quick to rule out the COVID-19 vaccine as the possible cause of some recent deaths reported by the media to have occurred after vaccination.   These medical doctors should have presumed the vaccine could be the cause of these deaths until it is actually ruled out in a formal investigation, he said.     All requests for compensation are welcome   The financial compensation being offered in case of COVID-19 vaccination adverse events, allowed under Section 41 of the 2002 National Health Security Act, is simply preliminary assistance.   That explains why no results of a formal investigation into these suspected vaccination adverse events are required before the financial compensation is paid to the affected party requesting for the financial assistance, he said.   “Just submit your requests and the NHSO’s 13 sub-committees in all health regions nationwide will examine your cases with the help of a panel of medical experts who will base their decisions on your medical history and all other information concerned,” he said.     “So, please submit every suspected case to the sub-committee even if your doctors told you it wasn’t the vaccine that caused these suspected symptoms. The sub-committee will examine and decide on the case, not your doctors or anyone else,” he said.   Since the NHSO hasn’t specified as to how long from vaccination until a person begins experiencing symptoms suspected to be vaccination adverse events, he or she may still submit a request for the compensation even if it is two weeks after vaccination.   And even though it will be less likely to be the vaccination that causes such symptoms, one should never judge on his or her own that any suspected symptoms aren’t the vaccine’s side effects, he said.   No recalls of money already paid   In case of illnesses or injuries suspected to have been caused by side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine, even though the NHSO has indicated that only “persistent conditions” will be compensated for those suffering temporary conditions can still submit their cases to the NHSO for consideration, he said.   The reason is, he said, some patients may not be totally aware of their symptoms that actually developed from the beginning until they realise they actually have these symptoms when later asked about them by their doctors.   “A key reason behind our willingness to receive all complaints about possible side effects of the vaccine is because we would like to hear about as many as possible side effects of the vaccine. And there are no better ways to know than to listen to the vaccine recipients,” he said.   “Without feedback from vaccine recipients, improvement in the vaccine development won’t happen,” he said. “We also want to know what type of side effects of the vaccine we will have to prepare to cope with when a larger number of people get vaccinated.”   “Everyone has to understand that the one who will decide as to who will or will not be compensated for isn’t doctors handling the vaccination or vaccine recipients themselves, but the NHSO’s sub-committee,” he said.   “And once again the money already paid as preliminary assistance to affected parties under the sub-committee’s decisions won’t be recalled, no matter what happens later,” he said.   Payment guaranteed to be done in five working days   As soon as the sub-committee approves the compensation, the payment is normally done in five working days after that, said the NHSO Secretary-General.   Over the past three weeks after the compensation programme was launched, about 260 requests for the compensation have been received, 162 of which have already been compensated for, he said.   The most common form of symptoms compensated for was persistent numbness, which ranged from one day to a month, he said.   A total of six requests for death compensation have also been received, he said.   Request submission is very simple as only some information is needed when filling in a compensation request form, namely the national ID number, the name of the vaccination venue, symptoms and a bank account number, he said.   The request form may be submitted to the vaccination venue, the Provincial Public Health Office or the NHSO’s Regional Offices, he said.   And following the launch of the mass vaccination drive on June 7, 2021, the NHSO now allows health volunteers across the country to receive filled in compensation request forms from the affected vaccine recipients and submit them on their behalf to the NHSO through the three main channels aforementioned, he said.   Active case finding on social media   Moreover, the NHSO’s Regional Offices are now assigned to monitor posts on the social media that may contain a complaint about possible COVID-19 vaccination adverse events and promptly contact the persons posting the information online in order to help them to seek compensation, he said.   And in the event that the number of cases of suspected vaccination adverse events surges and overwhelms the existing 13 sub-committees, more sub-committees will be appointed to ease the workload, he said.   “More importantly, some representatives of the public will possibly in the future be allowed to sit on these sub-committees as well, in a bid to garner more views from the public on the compensation programme,” he said.   Because the compensation programme for adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination is such a new process in Thailand, it will need more time to be adjusted and fine-tuned, he said.   Any questions about the compensation programme are therefore encouraged to be asked without hesitation to the NHSO hotline 1330.

170,190, ​People urged to get jabs as June 7 mass vaccination kicks off   Tue 08 June 2021  ,"   People urged to get jabs as June 7 mass vaccination kicks off   As the country’s mass COVID-19 vaccination drive begins today (June 7, 2021), members of the public are assured vaccines being used in the national immunisation programme are safe and effective.   People are also encouraged to get vaccinated against the novel coronavirus as soon as they are offered a jab so that the country will be able to reach herd immunity and everyone in this country will become safer from new infection.     There are two important messages for all people living in Thailand, said Dr Daniel A. Kertesz, the World Health Organization (WHO) representative to Thailand.   Vaccines against COVID-19 are effective and safe and eligible people in Thailand are being encouraged to get vaccinated against COVID-19 as soon as possible, said Dr Kertesz.   “The WHO country office will be with all Thai authorities in the beginning of the mass vaccination campaign as we have been being with them since January 2020 and will be with them until the outbreak is over,” he said.     Current preliminary data suggests the COVID-19 vaccines approved by WHO stimulate enough immunity to retain substantial efficacy against most variants of SARS-CoV-2, especially for severe disease, hospitalisation and death, said Dr Soumya Swaminathan, WHO Chief Scientist.   Vaccines offer better immunity    These COVID-19 vaccines offer much higher levels of immune response than natural immunity acquired through natural COVID-19 infection, which only last approximately six months, she said.   The protection rendered by COVID-19 vaccination should hopefully last longer, she said, adding that WHO is determining whether COVID-19 booster shots will be needed to cope with SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.   As so far more than 1.8 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in 211 countries, areas, territories and economies, monitoring mechanisms remain in place to ensure safety and efficacy of these vaccines in real-world applications, she said.   And while there still are limited supplies of COVID-19 vaccines, WHO is recommending countries to prioritise as to who should get the vaccine first, she said.   Healthcare workers, front-line workers, the elderly, people with underlying medical conditions, and communities with high risk of infection should be given a priority in the vaccine drive in each country, she said.   WHO has been working together with countries currently carrying out COVID-19 vaccination programmes, to form a cohort to follow up on vaccines’ efficacy, protectiveness and adverse events following vaccinations, she said.   “Thailand has an excellent system to do this. It has very good infrastructure and can provide a lot of data to the world,” she said.      Equal access for all   Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha has policy to ensure equal access to COVID-19 by all Thais and foreigners living in Thailand, said Dr Sopon Iamsirithaworn, deputy director-general of Department of Disease Control.   A small-scale COVID-19 inoculation programme began on February 28, 2021, and has been continuing up until now that the mass vaccination rollout begins on June 7, 2021, he said. The limited supplies of COVID-19 vaccines imported previously were intended mainly for front-line healthcare workers, while the mass vaccination drive will from June 7, 2021 be focused on a second group of target population – people who are 60 years old and older and people with underlying medical conditions, he said.   Vaccines will be allocated and distributed in approximately four rounds this month (June) because vaccine supplies have been and will continue to be delivered in batches, he said. Throughout last week, about 2 million doses of both the AstraZeneca and Sinovac vaccines have been distributed to the provinces ahead of the June 7, 2021 launch of the national mass vaccination programme, he said.   More vaccine supplies to come   By mid-June, a new round of vaccine distribution will begin when more supplies of the vaccines are delivered, he said, adding that between 5 and 6 million doses of these vaccines will be then distributed to all parts of the country this month.   For the time being, a priority will have to be given to Bangkok, Nonthaburi and Samut Prakan where the COVID-19 infection situation is far more serious than anywhere else, he said.   This means those areas with a less serious outbreak situation or with no new infections reported will possibly be given a smaller supply of the COVID-19 vaccine at the moment, he said.   After all, all areas of the country will in four to six months be supplied with an equal proportion of the vaccine, he said.   Previously, Thailand could administer at most 100,000 doses of the vaccine per day simply because the country had limited supplies of the vaccine, he said.   But now that more supplies of the vaccine have arrived and the mass vaccination programme is launched, at least 500,000 doses will be administered on the first day of the programme (June 7, 2021), he said.      Actual vaccination capacity   The country actually has a capacity of injecting between 500,000 and 1 million doses of the vaccine per day and about 10 million doses per month if it has sufficient vaccine supplies, he said.   Both Thais and foreigners living in the country are eligible to receive the vaccine under the mass vaccination programme, he said.   Thailand aims to secure 100 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine and administer them all by the end of this year, said Dr Nakorn Premsri, the director of National Vaccine Institute. As of June 1, 2021, a contract has been signed on a supply of 61 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which will be delivered in batches from June onwards, he said.   Six million doses of between 10 and 15 million doses of the Sinovac vaccine secured in a contract, plus 1 million doses of the same vaccine donated by the Chinese government to Thailand, have already been delivered, while 3 million more doses will arrive in each of the following months, he said.   A contract for a supply of 20 million doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and another contract for a supply of 5 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine are being negotiated, he said.   Negotiations by a number of other parties for supplies of other COVID-19 vaccines, namely Moderna, Sinophram, and Sputnik V as alternative choices are underway, he said. NHSO’s role in mass vaccination   As part of the government’s COVID-19 inoculation programme, the National Health Security Office (NHSO) has been funding not only the arrangement of COVID-19 vaccination units outside of the hospitals, but also a financial compensation programme for people suffering from side effects of the vaccine and adverse event following vaccinations.     Anyone, with or without a COVID-19 vaccination insurance policy, who suspects he or she encounter a side effect of the vaccine is encouraged to consult a medical doctor and file a request for compensation under this programme, said Dr Jadej Thammatach-aree, secretary-general of the NHSO.   The compensation programme is a mechanism to ensure all people that they will be promptly taken care of if they ever experience any serious side effects of the vaccine, he said.   As of June 2, about two weeks after the compensation programme was launched, a total of 250 petitions have been filed for compensation and 150 of them have already been compensated for, he said.   Most of these cases were persistent numbness that required hospital admission, he said. “I’m very impressed at the trust Thai people have in the healthcare system, doctors, nurses and other healthcare providers…This will largely benefit the country’s immunisation campaign,” Dr Kertesz.

171,192," NHSO works behind the scenes to help hospitals, patients cope with COVID-19   Wed 28 April 2021  ","   NHSO works behind the scenes to help hospitals, patients cope with COVID-19  As the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues to take its toll on Thailand’s healthcare system, National Health Security Office (NHSO) has been committing itself to fully supporting healthcare providers and improving public access to necessary services during this lingering health crisis.  By early April, several private hospitals had announced to suspend their COVID-19 testing services, which were in high demand as the COVID-19 outbreak began flaring up again. The NHSO was then prompted to find out why. And as it turned out, it wasn’t financial compensation rates the NHSO offered to these hospitals that had led to the service suspension decision, but two other key reasons.    Due to a surge in number of people seeking COVID-19 tests at these hospitals, some of them had run out of testing solutions while other became reluctant to test more customers for COVID-19 because they were concerned they wouldn’t have enough bed to accommodate more infected people, said Dr Jadej Thammatach-aree, Secretary-General of the NHSO.  However, later after a discussion was held between the NHSO and the Private Hospital Association, the latter assured that the private hospital that had suspended their COVID-19 testing services resumed the services on April 9, said Dr Jadej.     There at that time no longer was shortage of testing solutions while the government began working together with these private hospitals in preparing more forms of field hospitals for COVID-19 infected patients with mild symptoms, he said.  The NHSO pays all hospitals and other healthcare facilities willing to share healthcare resources including beds, no matter if they are public-run or private ones, said the NHSO Secretary-General.  Those who tested positive but show no symptoms of infection will instead be taken to a so-called hospitel or field hospital.  All people at risk of contracting the coronavirus are thus assured they will receive a COVID-19 test free of charge at either public-run or private hospitals, said Dr Jadej, adding that the higher the number of COVID-19 tests are carried out, the better the COVID-19 containment will become.  The NHSO pays hospitals offering COVID-19 testing or treatment including field hospitals and hospitels that provide care to COVID-19 infected patients.  At most 1,600 baht is paid for a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) COVID-19 test, another 100 baht for specimen collecting and handling, and 600 baht more for other related fees.  The maximum payment for the cost of in-patient medication is 7,200 baht per patient, while the cost of nursing is paid at most 2,500 baht per day. The cost of COVID-19 patient caring in the hospital, the hospitel or the field hospital is paid at most 1,500 baht per day.  More than 1.9 billion baht have been paid by the NHSO to healthcare facilities concerned, between October last year (the beginning of fiscal year 2021) and March this year. Of which, 1.8 billion baht went to funding COVID-19 screening and the other 101 million to paying COVID-19 treatment costs.  And since April 10, Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul has assigned the NHSO to coordinate the work of locating available hospital beds for COVID-19 infected patients waiting for their turns to be admitted to the hospital for treatment.  The Department of Medical Services (DMS) together with National Institute for Emergency Medicine (NIEM) is mainly responsible for performing this task using the DMS’ hotline 1668 to receive phone calls from hospitals that detect new COVID-19 cases yet no longer have any more available beds for them.  The NHSO now utilises its hotline 1330 to help the DMS out with handling such calls and finding hospital beds for new COVID-19 patients.  In their cooperation, the DMS and the NHSO work alongside to receive calls for help with bed finding and allocating, while the NIEM is responsible for transporting patients from their homes to the hospital.  With these partners working together, calls for help are received and processed around the clock, said Dr Jadej.  By around mid-April (April 17), the number of COVID-19 patients on a waiting list to get admitted to the hospital reached 700, most of who were asymptomatic cases, he said. These patients, however, weren’t left stranded a home without any help at all, he said. While waiting for beds, officers from either the DMS or the NHSO call them every day to inquire about their health until the day they are actually admitted to the hospital when bed are available for them.  At that time the NHSO took care of about 400 patients and the rest were under the DMS’s care.    “We totally understand how these COVID-19 patients are feeling while having to wait until beds are available…but you won’t be left alone. Our staff will be calling you every day to check on and listen to you,” said DMS Director-General Dr Somsak Akksilp.  As of April 17, beds had been found for about of all patients needing to be admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 treatment, he said.  In case of emergency or that any patients later develop severe symptoms while waiting, they may call to any of these two hotlines for urgent help and an ambulance will be then dispatched to take them to the hospital as soon as possible, he said.  Dr Somsak insisted his department and the NHSO are trying to speed up their work of finding hospital beds for the infected patients who still are waiting or those who shows no symptoms at all.    "
172,193, NHSO improves claims process to cope with new-emerging phase of COVID-19   Fri 23 April 2021  ,"   NHSO improves claims process to cope with new-emerging phase of COVID-19    Thailand is battling the new-emerging phase of COVID-19 infections, with the detection of highly contagious UK strain in cluster links to an entertainment venue in Bangkok.   This week, over 1,000 new infections are reported daily. Many of them do not show symptoms, increasing the chance for the virus to spread quickly. As of April 19, more than 43,700 confirmed cases and 104 deaths are reported in Thailand.    The rise of daily new cases presses the country's need for public health resources to handle COVID-19 patients and prevent the spread of the disease.    National Health Security Office (NHSO), which oversees Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) and reimbursement of medical expenses from public health funds, must adjust its fund management system to catch up with rising healthcare needs.     Speed up the claims process      Recently, NHSO secretary-general Dr Jadej Thammathat-Aree works with his staff to speed up claims processing for hospital operators.   In a normal situation, the claims process takes around one month to transfer public health funds to hospital operators providing health services to the Thai government's healthcare schemes.     The process is recently shortened to two weeks to allow hospital operators to cope with the rising cost resulted from the flood of coronavirus confirmed cases.      ""This will maintain financial liquidity for hospital operators who must provide emergency services every day,"" said Dr Jadej.  ""Speeding up the claiming process is in NHSO's to-do list for some years. Coronavirus pandemic accelerates that. We're on the path to transform our ICT system to improve the efficiency of the claiming process,""   Besides, NHSO has applied online patient verification solutions to improve patient service efficiency while integrating artificial intelligence technology into the audit system.    From Oct 2020 to March 2021, NHSO reimbursed 1.86-billion-baht public health funds for hospitals and laboratories providing COVID-19 screening tests. Over 781,625 tests were conducted. Nearly 1.5 billion baht was reimbursed for health units providing COVID-19 treatment to 31,488 infectious cases.       Partner with the public health authority   NHSO has partnered with the Public Health Ministry's Department of Health (DoH), which oversees public hospitals across Thailand, to reserve hospital beds for COVID-19 patients.   Both organizations' well-established hotlines are used as the contact points for patients requiring hospital beds.    Dr Pathomporn Siraprapasiri from Public Health Permanent Secretary Office said depending on where patients take the coronavirus screening tests.   Suppose they take the test at laboratories having the link to hospital networks and have positive test results. In that case, the lab staff will link patients to hospital staff who will seek available beds in their facilities or hospital networks.    If the laboratories do not have the link to hospital networks, patients have to notify their bed needs via one of these channels; DOH's 1668 hotline, NHSO's 1330, 1669 emergency hotline, or @Sabaideebot (Public Health Ministry's Line account created for monitoring and assisting COVID-19 patients).   Dr Narong Aphikulvanich, Public Health Ministry's inspector, said that around 700 COVID-19 infected people had required hospital beds via DoH's and NHSO's hotlines.   While they are waiting for beds at home, staff from both organizations call them regularly to monitor their symptoms and update the procedure of their bed reservation.    ""We understand that patients waiting for hospital beds may feel worried. We can assure them that no one will be left behind. We are doing our best to take care of them. When they get hospital beds, we will arrange transportation to pick them up,"" said Dr Narong.    "

Thai UHC safeguards equity in access to essential health services without financial hardship for everyone at all situations when needed, and in particular during the COVID pandemic.    The Thai government commits to ensuring universal access to both COVID services and other essential health services.   Throughout the pandemic, the government has prepared emergency response funds for public and private hospitals to tackle the pandemic, covering everyone, including Thais and non-Thais through  the management of the UC Scheme. The budget covers the cost of screening and testing for people at risk, health services, and medical supplies relating to COVID including personal protective equipment, control room operations, patients’ quarantines and their meals, medication, and hospital transfer vehicles.   Part of the prepared budget for COVID is distributed to Local Administrative Organizations through the Community Health Fund, to empower local community level tracking of the coronavirus. Community and Civil Society Organization’s engagement is vital to the success of UHC in fighting against COVID. Thailand’s village health volunteers have been working to support the prevention, detection, and control of the pandemic.     In order to achieve equitable access for all groups of people, we must involve them in the decision-making process as well.   The Board of Thai UC Scheme is inclusive and transparent. As the Minister of Public Health, I am the chairperson of the Board. Among 30 board members, there are five health professionals and five civil society leaders representing nine groups of vulnerable and marginalized people. Monthly meetings of the Board are webcasted live, reflecting its transparency.   Participatory processes can ensure good governance of UHC only when partners play active roles in deliberations and negotiations in the Board meetings. This will ensure that UHC is a public policy owned by the people and governed by inclusive stakeholders.   This is what we call 4PW or Participatory Public Policy Processes based on Wisdom.   On World Health Day this year, I urge all partners in South-East Asia to truly fulfill the goals of health for all and leaving no one behind by promoting inclusivity of all key stakeholders in the decision-making processes and implementation of the UHC policy.   Equity is universal and not limited to the COVID context only. Translating UHC into real practice and strengthening it further as Thailand has done for almost two decades will help us not only fight the pandemic but also drive us all towards better and fairer health services for everyone.   Thank you.

174,197, Involving private clinics in UCS improves physical therapy outreach   Mon 15 March 2021  ,"   Involving private clinics in UCS improves physical therapy outreach    Since the beginning of this year, 25 private physical therapy and rehabilitation clinics start participating in Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) by providing health services to patients with stroke, traumatic brain, and spinal cord injury.    It is a piloted program, led by National Health Security Office (NHSO) and public hospitals run by Public Health Ministry, to improve people's access to healthcare, especially for patients who find difficulties in commuting to hospitals.      Some progress is made as health workers reported the improvement of patients' physical therapy outreach, said Dr Sakchai Kanjanawatana, NHSO Secretary-General, adding that NHSO covers patients' health service fees.     ""Before the program is started, patients could only get physical therapies at hospitals. Access to physical therapies is considered very low because the number of physiotherapists is limited. Many patients are in severe health conditions, preventing them from leaving their houses,"" said Somjai Luewisetpaibul, President of Physical Therapy Council.   Physiotherapists are not always available at the government's subdistrict-level hospitals located within local community areas.     ""A patient with stroke is required to attend 20 sessions of physical therapy to recover fully. But our survey found that patients in some communities could join only five to 10 sessions,"" said Somjai.   ""To involve private clinics in providing physical therapies will fill up this gap. Most of these clinics have operated within communities for some time.""   Twenty-five clinics joining the UCS are mainly based in cities, including Bangkok metropolitan and eastern economic zone. Each clinic has at least one physiotherapist and passes health authorities' standard check. Its operator also obtains a license under Thai health regulation.    State hospitals have transferred patients to those clinics since they involve with UCS. Patients' health condition data is shared among health providers.     ""When the network of health providers is formed up, patients can get better access to quality health services,"" said Dr Jirasak Wijakkanalan, Director of Debaratana Nakon Ratchasima Hospital in Nakhon Ratchasima, a province in Thailand's northeastern region. His hospital staff works closely with two local rehabilitation clinics to provide physical therapies to UCS beneficiaries, who can now request access to the treatments in the clinics near home.   Hospital staff also invite physiotherapists from the clinics to evaluate the conditions and therapeutic outcomes of patients.    ""We will need to monitor the outcomes of the program, which focuses on patients with stroke, traumatic brain, and spinal cord injury,"" said Somjai.   ""If it is successful, we should expand the program's coverage to other patient groups, including people with disabilities and elderly, who also need physical therapies.""

175,199, Strength Community: A key to tackle COVID-19 in Nan   Thu 04 Febuary 2021  ,"    Strength Community: A key to tackle COVID-19 in Nan   Nan is the only few provinces in Thailand that reported “zero case” during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic last year, although it is surrounded by provinces with confirmed cases. This success is the result of the cooperation among local communities, along with local authorities’ implementation of strict public health measures.   A receipt of Nan’s success was discussed during the Wednesday virtual field trip at the sideline of Prince Mahidol Award Conference 2021.   STRONG COOPERATION   “The cooperation among multi-stakeholders has been the strength of Nan people. When facing a challenge or threat such as COVID-19, they play to their strength right away,” said Dr Chatree Charoensiri, member of Nan Civil Society Coordinating Center.   “Nan province has its unique characteristics with high civic consciousness.” He pointed out that four factors had contributed to the success of Nan in controlling the spread of COVID-19.   First, Thai health system has penetrated the walls of households, through over one million village health volunteers introduced by Public Health Ministry in 1978.   Each volunteer looked after between 10 and 15 households, and reported to local health officer when new visitors entered their communities during the pandemic.   Second, local authorities have worked with local community members who conveyed information from the internet and authorities to households. They also helped to translate information into local and ethnic dialects.   Third, basic needs such as food were available to local communities even though the transport and logistics were disrupted during the lockdown. For example, at Song Kwae District in Nan, local communities initiated sharing vegetable farms where every community member can get food for their households.   Finally, Nan provincial office developed software that linked and collected data of visitors and local people crossing the border. Visitors must register their arrival and destination on the authority’s online platform when they entered Nan.   Their data would be shared among local authorities and health officer, who would then alert village health volunteers to visit the visitors’ residences.   CIVIL SOCIETY ENGAGEMENT    As soon as Thailand’s first local transmission was reported in January last year, local people in Nan formed up “Chao Nan Tann COVID” or Nan Civil Society against COVID group.   Charee Chaichana, the group’s core member, said that all began when people in Nan discussed the COVID-19 situation on Line application and took action to prevent local people from getting infected by the virus.   They set up a Line Chat group and attracted 500 members within an hour. Soon after that, they persuaded the local government to close the province’s border while sharing information about safety and hygiene.   “Nan has a specific context as we have many ethnic communities living here. If there is one infected case, and there is a high probability that the virus will spread to other community members. Doing the disease prevention would be difficult after that,” said Charee.     “Aside from cooperation, another crucial aspect is the courage to do the right thing. We feed up to date information to local communities, which would help them make a decision concerning the COVID-19 situation,” said Dr Warinthep Chuasamran, Nan Provincial Chief Medical Officer.   Local authorities regularly updated information with the Center for Covid-19 Situation Administration (CCSA), the central government body dealing with the pandemic, and informed local communities of the government’s measures and policies.   Those measures include travel restriction, social distancing, promoting personal hygiene such as wearing faces masks and regular handwashing.   “The most important part was to tell the fact to local people as immediate as possible, and it must come from reliable sources. Our main source was CCSA,” said Dr Warinthep.   COMMUNITY HEALTH FUND   Community Health Fund (CHF), a program for the empowerment of local communities, was an essential mechanism that helped Nan people control the spread of COVID-19 effectively. Introduced by National Health Security Office, the government agency overseeing Universal Coverage Scheme, CHF provides emergency fund to local administrative organizations to initiate health promotion and disease prevention programs at a community level.   At Nan, part of the fund was spent to supply necessary materials and paid for transportation for village health volunteers who must regularly visit households.   Anuchsri Mongkol, chief of village health volunteers in Song Kwae district of Nan, said that during the Songkran Holiday (or Thai New Year day) in April, the volunteers must monitor the arrival visitors in the communities---mainly, family members who worked in other provinces and wanted to return home during the holiday.   As Nan border was strictly controlled, they couldn’t access their home villages. The village health volunteers must inform them of the government policies and encouraged them to temporally changed their behaviors to reduce the communities’ risk of exposure to COVID-19.   “Our community live like families, so they listen to us and comply with public health measures,” said Anuchsri.   As of 29 January, one confirmed case is reported in Nan following the discovery of new hotspot at a seafood wholesale market in Samut Sakhon in December last year--- which Thai government called the new-emerging phase of COVID-19.     “For this phase, we’re confident that we could handle it. Because we learned a lot from the first wave,” said Narongrit Siriwongworaphat, Head of Narai Luang sub-district Administrative Organization, Song Kwae District in Nan Province.   “We keep screening people and tracking them once they enter Nan.”    "
176,200, SADAO District: Handle with influx of people at the border and rumors   Thu 04 Febuary 2021  ,"   SADAO District: Handle with influx of people at the border and rumors    Last year, COVID-19 spread to most parts of Thailand including Sadao, a district on the Thai-Malaysian border in Songkhla Province.   Despite the distance from cities where the confirmed cases were concentrated, local communities in Sadao were erupted with fear after some immigration officials there tested positive for coronavirus in April. Local authority suspected them of contracting the virus from the truck drivers who delivered goods back and forth across the border.    The anxiety in local communities hiked when around 60 people, mainly undocumented migrants, in the Immigration Police Office’s detention center were found theme tested positive too.    As the border can be crossed on foot, hundreds of Thai immigrants in Malaysia were found sneaking through the border for returning home. This geographical context created a challenge for local authorities and health workers who must handle both local transmission cases and the flux border.   Eventually, they were able to effectively control the spread of the coronavirus--with only 142 total confirmed cases today.   How did they make it? The Tuesday virtual field trip at the sideline of the Prince Mahidol Award 2021 revealed.      ENGAGE IMMIGRATION OFFICER     During the height of the pandemic, Dr Suwat Wiriyapongsukit, Director of the Sadao Hospital in Songkhla Province, worked tirelessly with his team to track people crossing the border.   They set up a field hospital and tested everyone who entered the border. But only the effort of health workers was not enough to control the spread of the coronavirus. They must engage immigration police officers who oversaw the border and had insight information.   “We operated an online training course for immigration police officers and built their capacity on screening and disease surveillance. They also learned how to reduce their risk of exposure to the coronavirus while on their duty,” said Dr Suwat.   “In the middle of the challenge, we can solve problem if we came up with good tactics and teamwork.”   The training course was developed by his team and staff of the Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University. Each officer many check-in online when starting their duty. Their body temperature was monitored. They were also provided with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).   TACKLE RUMORS    Rumors and false news about the COVID-19 was another challenge faced by health workers at the beginning of the pandemic. Because villagers not yet understood how the disease transmitted.   When the first local confirmed case was detected in Sadao, the whole communities when panic. The neighbors living close to the house of the man identified as a confirmed case forced his family to stop selling food for over two months. Soon the false news about the discovery of many new cases spread. Home quarantine was not allowed in some communities.   “We must hold a discussion with villagers to explain to them about COVID-19. We invited representatives from local administrative organizations, subdistrict health units, and local leaders,” said Dr Suwat.   The discussion concerned the nature of coronavirus transmission and the methods to prevent it. Then they conveyed the message to villagers to calm them down.    “When we communicated with villagers, they soon turned their panic into empathy. The first confirmed case eventually received a warm welcome from villagers when he was recovered and released from the hospital.”      Professor Dr.Virasakdi Chongsuvivatwong, Epidemiologist from Prince of Songkla University said that the challenge had remained for undocumented migrant population. As Songkhla hosts several industrial factories, there are some undocumented workers who hide from the public eyes in fear of being caught up --- despite Thai hospital offer free COVID-19 testing and treatment to everyone regardless of race and document status.   “We have to learn more about how to solve this problem,” said Prof. Dr Virasakdi.       A PROVINCIAL COMMITTEE     As people flux at the Thai-Malaysian border, Sadao authority turned the hotels located near the border into state quarantine facilities. People crossing the borders from Malaysia, even with a normal health condition, were required to stay at the state quarantine facility for at least 14 days   “At first, we expected hundreds of thousands of cases. We prepared a lot of resources; negative pressure rooms and respirators. We also organized cohort ward in every zone in Songkhla,” said Dr Utissak Harirattanakul, Songkhla Provincial Chief Medical Officer.   Songkhla governor set up the Communicable Disease Committee joined by multi-stakeholders, including health experts, university academics, local administrative organizations, and local businesses. They had a daily meeting to asset the situation and decide the strategy to respond to new cases and emerging situations.     The network of village health volunteers also played an essential role, by delivering information about the suspected cases in local communities to the doctors and committee.    “Each of us must collaborate during the crisis. We don’t blame each other. We don't blame patients,” said Dr Utissak.    "
177,202, Mahidol University: A key contributor to Thailand’s COVID-19 success story     Fri 29 January 2021  ,"   Mahidol University: A key contributor to Thailand’s COVID-19 success story     When the first COVID-19 case was discovered in Thailand in mid-January 2020, health experts, including those from Mahidol University, were summoned by the Thai government to plan for the strategy to curb the outbreak.   COVID-19 was an unknown disease at the time. Many questions emerged. How did the disease spread between people? What were the warning symptoms? What were the right measures to protect people from the virus? When would it end?     Though rolling to the uncertainty, Mahidol University’s faculties jumped in. Mahidol University is the leading academic university in Thailand and Asia that involves in the national fight against COVID-19. Its staff has collaborated across faculties and worked with Ministry of Public Health and related stakeholders to take immediate public health response to the pandemic.   “We have our strength in life science and medicine. Many staff has expertise in several subspecialties. They can provide the knowledge and carry on the research, and develop many medical innovations to support us in a crisis,” said Professor Dr Banchong Mahaisavariya, President of Mahidol University.   The university staff launched several innovations during the pandemic, including Cas13-based diagnostic kits LAMP PCR, food delivery robots, and a drive-through blood test to solve the challenge from social distancing. Some took part in COVID-19 monitoring and prevention program for vulnerable populations and local communities.   Their contribution was discussed during Prince Mahidol Award Conference’s virtual field trips on 25 January, which showed how the university staffs has deeply involved in the battle against COVID-19 and played prominent roles behind Thailand’s success story.   INVOLVE IN POLICY MAKING After the discovery of the first local transmission case, Thai government took an immediate response to set up the Center for COVID-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) — a platform in which the government works with health experts, researchers, and multi-stakeholders to curve the outbreak.   Several experts from Mahidol University joined the CCSA, including the former Public Health Minister Clinical Professor Emeritus Dr Piyasakol Sakolsatayadorn, who is also the chairman of Mahidol University Council.   “What happened was that we had a meeting nearly every day in an emergency operating system at the Public Health Permanent Secretary Office,” said Professor Dr Piyamitr Sritara, Dean of Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University.   “We tried our best to meet with the private sector to make a policy dialogue, and make the synergy between public health and the university’s research. We tried to find relevant research to answer what it needs, such as methods of testing, isolation, and treatment.”   Professor Dr Prasit Watanapa, Dean of Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, said during the virtual field trip that reducing the number of new cases was the key measure to controlling the spread of the virus.      “If you can reduce the number of new cases, there will be a reduction in the number of patients needing admission. The resources that seem lacking will be enough to be used. Because the number of cases admitted to hospitals seems to be decreasing,” he said.     Provide public information is necessary, he said. CCSA holds a press conference every day to update the situation, with the helping hands of Mahidol University’s experts who analyze the trend and impact of the outbreak.     During a press conference, the government spokesperson also urges people to comply with health measures and change their behaviors to reduce local transmission cases. To encourage them to collaborate, it is necessary to explain to them the reasons behind the government’s strict measures, including a curfew, travel restriction, and city lockdown.   EMPOWER LOCAL COMMUNITIES    “As the Faculty of Public Health, the university expects us to support any programs that can help in minimizing the burden of COVID-19. What we are keen on doing is working with the communities [to achieve that,] said Dr Chanuantong Tanasugarn, Dean of Faculty of Public Health, Mahidol University.   “We act as a middle man to translate the policy in relevant to the people and the culture in their communities or in their areas.”   The faculty staff has worked closely with village health volunteers to convey the right message to local communities, that can encourage them to change behaviors by wearing face masks, washing hands regularly, and complying with social distancing measures.     As COVID-19 is different from other diseases, the faculty staff offered training to village health volunteers to make them comprehend the new information concerning the novel coronavirus.   Once they have information, said Dr Chanuantong, they started following doctors’ guideline and sharing information to their peers — enabling them to analyze the outbreak situation, prevent themselves from the risk of exposure to the virus, and see the positive outcomes at the end.   “This is the way to empower them,” she said.   Mahidol University has run a district research center in a local community to promote health literary and good governance in healthcare policy, and bring in collaboration among researchers and local communities.   It also collaborated with National Health Security Office, the government agency overseeing Universal Coverage Scheme, to run COVID-19 monitoring and surveillance program for vulnerable people, including homeless people and inmates in Bangkok and neighboring provinces.   “The government policy is very effective to control the spread of infection, in which there is no significant evidence of disease dissemination among the homeless group,” said Professor Dr Chartchalerm Isarankura-na-Ayudhya, Dean, Faculty of Medical Technology, Mahidol University.    “Good policy, collaboration and good behaviors of Thai people made Thailand went through the COVID-19 crisis smoothly.""   SYNERGY   Apart from health expertise, engineering excellence of Mahidol University has also contributed to the management of coronavirus outbreak.     “At the time that we encountered COVID-19, we gathered our faculty staff and found out what we could make some contribution. We had already developed robot technology, so we came up with several approaches and solutions to use robots for food and drug delivery,"" Associate Professor Jackrit Suthakorn, Dean of Faculty of Engineering, Mahidol University said.    His staff integrated robotics into health services that reduce the physical contact between patients and healthcare workers. The robot is used to carry waste bins, deliver food and drug to patients under quarantine and treatment in patients area.   The faculty staff has also worked on developing Artificial Intelligence and data analysis technology for the healthcare sector.      “The synergy is the best thing that happens in our country. Not only leaders in the government, also Public Health Minister, researchers from universities, even private sector, join hand and make a contribution during the crisis,” said Dr Piyamitr.   As Thailand is experiencing the new-emerging phase of COVID-19, which started in mid-December last year from a seafood wholesale market in Samut Sakhon, the experience from the first outbreak helped the government and health experts dealing with the pandemic more effectively — without lock down the whole country, instead, implementing travel restriction at the coronavirus hotspot areas.   Dr Prasit said that the reason behind the policy changing was policymakers knowing better about COVID-19. Health facilities have better resources, including N95 masks and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).   Several innovations are currently available as a result of engineers’ contribution during the first wave. Finally, Thailand has the experience and learn about the disease from critically ill patients in the first wave. Now it can reduce the mortality rate in the new-emerging phase.   Moreover, Thai government set up emergency funds in respond to the outbreak, allowing every Thai in all healthcare schemes to access testing and treatment regardless of their financial circumstances.    “Funding work like an immune system,” said Dr Prasit.

178,204, Thai government prepares for the New-emerging phase COVID-19   Tue 26 January 2021  ,"   Thai government prepares for the New-emerging phase COVID-19    The number of new COVID-19 cases in Thailand have recently skyrocketed after months of calm. In Mid-December, Thai authorities found a new coronavirus cluster in migrant laborers working in a wholesale seafood market of Samut Sakhon Province. The virus has spread to other provinces across Thailand since then.     Amidst fear of the New-emerging phase, Thai government has pulled both financial and human resources and put them into health emergency response --- allowing health workers, local governments and communities to conduct disease surveillance, find suspected cases, and tested people with high potential exposure to the coronavirus.   Here is a summary of what Thailand has done to prepare and tackle the New-emerging phase   Set up COVID-19 emergency response funds    Thai government has allocated nearly three-billion-baht to National Health Security Office (NHSO) to fight COVID-19. The budget which is under a one-trillion-baht emergency loans decree, will cover the expenditure of the coronavirus healthcare services and health benefits in the first half of 2021.   NHSO, which acts as a National Clearinghouse for the government’s healthcare schemes, plans to spend 2.23 billion baht of the budget on healthcare services such as COVID-19 prevention services (1.97 billion baht) and treatment (230 million baht).     Other 771 million baht will cover influenza vaccination program (318 million baht), compensation for health workers affected by COVID-19 (87 million baht) and the Universal Coverage Scheme’s benefits for unemployed persons (366 million baht).      NHSO Secretary-General Dr Sakchai Kanjanawatana encourages Thai hospitals to provide healthcare services to everyone regardless of their race.   The budget provided under the emergency loans decree will cover the cost incurred from COVID-19 emergency response, including inpatient and outpatient services, ICU, lab test, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for health workers, Isolate room operations, patients’ quarantines and their meals, medication, and inter-hospital patient transfer.   More than 155,800 people were tested for coronavirus from October to December last year, equivalent to 468-million-baht reimbursement. Around 4,880 people received COVID-19 healthcare services, equivalent to 148-million-baht reimbursement.   Disease Control Department has set a budget for the coronavirus testing in migrant worker populations.   Prepare health facilities to meet people’s needs   Public Health Ministry has prepared hospitals and health workers for possible future outbreaks of COVID-19.   In Public Health Office Region 6th, covering eight provinces in central and eastern Thailand, the 10-100-1,000 strategy is designed to help healthcare systems cope with a potential new outbreak.   Ten stands for the numbers of total negative pressure rooms required in each province. 100 means the number of available beds in isolation wards, and 1,000 refers to the total number of beds required in field hospitals.   Hospitals in each province must prepare 100 to 200 additional beds for COVID-19 patients in a recovering stage. They work in large networks by sharing information and resources during the pandemic.      Dr Narong Aphikulwanich from Public Health Office Region 6th explains that the number of COVID-19 patients depends on the effectiveness of disease surveillance and suspected case finding.   Provide resources to local governments and communities      Local Administrative Organizations (LAOs) can request COVID-19 emergency project from Community Health Fund (CHF), the NHSO’s program for empowering local government and communities as well as encouraging them to initiate health promotion and disease prevention activities.   The past activities include community-based active case finding, alcohol gel and face masks distribution to residents, and the compensations for Village Health Volunteer networks.       Dr Peeramon Ningsanond, Director of NHSO Region 6 Rayong, said that NHSO had supported local health workers, administrative official, LAOs and civil society groups in tackling COVID-19.   They can work with a full effort as they don’t need to feel worried about their access to available resources.   Secure COVID-19 vaccines   In November last year, Ministry of Public Health signed an advance agreement with a British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca to secure a supply of its COVID-19 vaccines.   The agreement is for the purchase of 26 million doses, for 13 million people. AstraZeneca will also support the local mass production of the vaccines by Siam Bioscience, a Thai pharmaceutical manufacturing company.   Anutin Charnvirakul, Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister said that Thailand would receive COVID-19 vaccines by mid-year, before the Thai company can start local production.   Thai cabinet gave a green light to Public Health Ministry to purchase two million doses from China-based Sinovac, which will arrive in Thailand in February. They will be given to frontline healthcare workers and high-risk population groups.    "
179,206, Postal medicine delivery plays key role in telemedicine   Mon 16 November 2020  ,"   Postal medicine delivery plays key role in telemedicine   Despite a decline in the popularity of postal medication delivery after the Covid-19 outbreak in Thailand has subsided, sending medicines by hospitals to their patients by post has become the new normal in the work of pharmacists at most, if not all hospitals.   And from being a solution adopted to lower the number of unnecessary visits to the hospital when the new coronavirus outbreak situation peaked in Thailand months ago, the postal drug delivery service has now become a mechanism to as much as possible reduce overcrowding at the outpatient ward of state-run hospitals.   The service also serves as an important element of telemedicine that has become the new normal in Thailand’s healthcare system as well.   Miruntee Chongchuaklong, a senior pharmacist with state-run Pakchongnana Hospital in Pak Chong district of Nakhon Ratchasima, still remembered vividly how hectic it was at the hospital’s pharmaceutical department months earlier.   A way of coping with hospital overcrowding   Just every day, a huge number of patients were waiting to pick up their medicines after seeing doctors, which made it hard for pharmacists to manage to explain to all patients about their medication to ensure they follow the instructions and take medicine safely and effectively.   By the time her department proposed for the hospital to switch partially to sending patients by post their regular medication for chronic diseases, the hospital was only beginning to implement the Rap Yai Klai Ban (Get your medicines near your home) project, she said.   And since the hospital’s system for dispensing medicines to its patients through local pharmacies under that project wasn’t really ready while the hospital had to bring down the number of hospital visitors for the sake of social distancing during the Covid-19 outbreak, postal delivery of medicines became an ideal solution, she said.   Patients interested in having their medicines sent to them at home by post were encouraged to sign up for the programme through the hospital’s social media including its Facebook page, she said.   Doctors’ approval and patients’ consent needed   Only patients whose doctors agree it is totally safe for them to continue taking the same medicines without having to come to the hospital to see doctors are allowed to take part in this postal drug dispensing programme, she said.   Photos of medicines along with instructions are printed out and included into medicine parcels sent the patients, to check if they receive correct items of medication and follow the instructions given, she said.   Pharmacists normally call these patients one by one both before they send medicines to them and after the patients have received their medicine parcels to ensure their medicines surely reach them, she said.   In case these patients later need help or have a question about their medication, they can instead visit either a health promotion hospital in their communities or a pharmacy near them that is taking part in the hospital’s drug dispensing pharmacy programme, she said. The hospital communicates instantly with these community hospitals and pharmacies via Line, a popular social media application, she said.   Health promotion hospitals, pharmacies involved   These community hospitals and pharmacies also help the hospital with measuring these patients’ vital signs and giving them blood sugar tests when necessary, which are extra services highly appreciated by the patients, she said.   A number of these patients now visit their doctors in person at the hospital only once in a while as they continue receiving their medicine by post, she said.   Certain types of patients such as ones with mental condition are being advised to regularly undergo an assessment of their symptoms at a health promotion hospital near them, to decide whether they should continue taking the same medicines or change them.   In case of changing medication, the patients will later be appointed to see their psychiatrists through a telemedicine programme at the same community hospital, in which their doctors will see them from the hospital, she said.   As of Sept 9, 2020, a total of 209 hospitals under the universal coverage (UCS) scheme and 128,141 patients were taking part in this postal medicine delivery programme, according to the National Health Security Office (NHSO).     Delivery costs will come down   The NHSO now pays Thailand Post 50 baht per medication parcel handling and expects to bring the cost of the postal medicine delivery down to 30 baht per time next year when more than 400 hospitals are expected to join the programme.   Thailand Post guarantees that every medication parcel reaches its recipient in no more than three days no matter where he or she lives, said Dr Sakchai Kanjanawatana, Secretary-General of the NHSO.   Aside from being an ideal option for delivering medicines to patients in the event of a second wave of the Covid-19 outbreak, postal medication delivery is also considered a key element in telemedicine and telehealth, which are the future of the country’s healthcare system, said Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul.   Thailandpost Distribution Co, a subsidiary of Thailand Post, is now piloting a new service of delivering medication in temperature-controlled cars in Bangkok and the surrounding provinces, which is expected to be expanded to cover more provinces from next year, said Thailand Post chief executive Korkij Danchaivichit.        "
180,207, More patients prefer picking up medication at pharmacies near them   Fri 13 November 2020  ,"   More patients prefer picking up medication at pharmacies near them   Starting out last year, Rap Ya Klai Ban (Get your medicines near your home) project is gaining popularity. It is heading to a new stage, in which more privately-owned pharmacies will be contracted to fully manage a pharmaceutical stock specifically for prescriptions given to patients under the universal coverage (UCS) scheme.   In the first stage of the project’s development, a number of hospitals under the UHC simply delivered medication to their patients through local pharmacies joining this initiative, while in the second stage of it these hospitals began storing medication at the contracted pharmacies but still handled their UHC stocks for the pharmacies. Pharmacists at these pharmacies, meanwhile, were permitted to distribute the drugs to patients with a prescription given by their doctors under the UHC.   “Aside from improving patients’ convenience, this project also proved effective in reducing overcrowding in the hospital,” said Dr Sakchai Kanjanawatana, Secretary-General of the National Health Security Office (NHSO).   Time-saving initiative   An assessment carried out by Health Intervention and Technology Assessment Program (HITAP) ten months after the project was official launched on Oct 1, last year, showed the project helped cut by 22% of the time normally spent by patients in travelling to the hospital and waiting in a long queue for their medication and reduce by between 10% and 20% in hospital overcrowding.   As of Aug 1, 2020, a total of 130 hospitals under the UHC and 1,033 pharmacies have been taking part in this new medication dispensing programme, said Dr Jakkrit Ngowsiri, Deputy Secretary-General of the NHSO.   Initially, only 50 hospitals and 500 were expected to participate in the programme, he said, adding that close to 20,000 patients were receiving medication under this programme. The NHSO aims to increase the number of patients participating in the programme to 36,450 in 2021, he said.   A vast majority of the hospitals joining the programme are general hospitals (37.69%), followed by hospitals that are medical centres (25.38%), he said.   Most of these hospitals (80.77%), however, still prefer the first model of medication dispensing, in which they have the medication sent to the contracted pharmacies first and then ask their patients to pick their medicines up at these pharmacies, he said. Convenience of patients   A vast majority of patients joining this programme (7,894) are the people aged between 61 and 75, followed 6,280 patients who are between 46 and 60 years old, while only 2,563 patients who are older than 75 years old and 1,644 patients aged between 31 and 45 are taking part in the same programme, he said.   Most of these patients are receiving their medicines distributed through pharmacies for one or more chronic diseases including high blood pressure, diabetes and other related health problems, while 892 patients are receiving medication for mental illnesses, he said.   Chiangrai Prachanukroh Hosptial in Chiang Rai has recorded the highest number of 3,515 patients taking part in the medication distribution programme, followed Hatyai Hospital in Songkla (1,805) and Phrachomklao Hospital in Phetchaburi (1,128), Lamphun Hospital in Lam Phun (963) and Nakhonpathom Hospital in Nakhon Pathom (859), he said.   Lamphun Hospital’s experience   Dr Phongsak Sophon, the director of Lamphun Hospital, said the average waiting time per patient at the hospital has been shortened by 37% from about 32 minutes to only 19 minutes after implementing the medication dispensing programme.   Calling the programme telepharmacy, the doctor said it was part of the hospital’s telemedicine brought in place to promote social distancing to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus that causes Covid-19.   “By word of mouth, more and more patients impressed by the service keep recommending peers to take part in this programme…We are now moving on to Model 3,” said the doctor, referring to contracting pharmacies to fully manage a drug stock for the hospitals’ UHC patients who are receiving medicines from them instead of the pharmaceutical department of these hospitals.   Move on to next step   In a transition to the Phase 3 of the project, beginning on Oct 1, 2020, the Government Pharmaceutical Organisaton (GPO) now is handling drug purchases and distributing them to the pharmacies under this programme through its vendor managed inventory (VMI) system, said Anunchai Assawamakin, an assistant to Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul.   Those pharmacies that are ready to handle the drug stock for the UHC on their own will soon be allowed to do so, said Mr Anunchai who is a pharmacist.   Three core challenges facing the project were identified in a recent evaluation of it, namely low coverage, a subsidy provided under this project being far below the actual costs of it and a lack of sophisticated IT systems to support data sharing between hospitals and pharmacies, said Dr Suwit Wibulpolprasert, a member of the NHSO's board.   He recommended expanding the telepharmacy programme to cover 50% of the UCS’s hospitals next year.        "
181,209, Public awareness will sustain country’s food safety promotion and health prevention   Thu 29 October 2020  ,"   Public awareness will sustain the country’s food safety promotion and health prevention   Organic farming is the right path to achieving the country’s food safety goal while educating and empowering consumers and farmers will sustain efforts to totally ban the use of hazardous chemicals in agriculture, a recent seminar was told.   A positive sign observed over the past years is an increase in the number of groups of consumers dedicated to making consumption of safe and healthy food their lifestyle, said Dr. Sakchai Kanjanawatana, Secretary-General of the National Health Security Office (NHSO).   He was speaking at a seminar entitled “Banning the 3 chemicals will prolong lives of Thais”, which was held on Sept 9, 2020, in Bangkok by the NHSO. The three chemicals discussed at the seminar were chlorpyrifos, paraquat, and glyphosate. Chlorpyrifos and paraquat are now banned in Thailand while the use of glyphosate is being limited.   While legal measures for limiting or eliminating the use of hazardous farm chemicals still are needed, awareness among consumers and farmers about the importance of ensuring supplies of food free of these chemicals will sustain efforts to make Thailand’s agriculture totally organic for the sake of public health, food safety, and sustainable farming, he said. The NHSO and the government will continue their roles in educating these people about the importance of organic farming as a means of living a healthy life, he said.   Through local health promotion funds, the NHSO has been supporting communities across the country to grow their own vegetables for consumption and healthy food at home without using farm chemicals, he said, adding that monitoring levels of farm chemical residues in their blood also is an effective approach in encouraging locals to adopt more organic farming at home.   Changes leading to better control of dangerous farm chemicals observed in the past years were a result of improvement in knowledge and awareness among members of the public about the impact on their health of the use of these chemicals in farming, said Witoon Lianchamroon, director of Biodiversity Sustainable Agriculture Food Sovereignty Action Thailand (BIOTHAI).   Dissemination of information and knowledge about the danger of these farm chemicals and the promotion of organic farming as a key element in developing the country’s food safety system will have to continue, he said.   Despite an extremely low rate of Thai farmers’ access to resources provided by the government for promoting organic agriculture found in a recent study (0.3%), compared with 90% in their access to chemical-based agriculture, there has been a success story to learn from, he said.   The northeastern province of Yasothon now sees one-third of its farmers switching to organic farming, thanks to their increased awareness about the danger of farm chemicals, he said.   This is hoped to set a good example for other provinces and communities and convince the government to work harder to improve public access to organic farming knowledge and resources, he said.   Sikkim, a state in northeastern India, took ten years to accomplish its 100% organic farming ambition, which was a result of strong political commitment by the local government, he said.   Saree Aungsomwang, Secretary-General of Foundation for Consumers, meanwhile raised a critical question as to why these three hazardous farm chemicals still are allowed in other countries although they are banned in the countries producing them.   “It’s something that should never happen, not only in Thailand but also elsewhere in the world. This is totally unacceptable,” she said.   She urged the government to also ban glyphosate, saying recent studies found that limiting the use of glyphosate is in reality “impractical”.   In the US, Giant German chemical and pharmaceutical maker Bayer, which acquired two years ago Monsanto, had in June agreed to pay more than $10 billion to settle tens of thousands of cancer claims, she said.   Monsanto is an American agrochemical and agricultural biotechnology corporation and the producer of the world’s best-known weedkiller, Roundup, which contains glyphosate as a key ingredient.   Over the past, four to five years, between 1,000 and 2,000 patients were each year admitted to the hospitals for treatment of acute symptoms caused by exposure to these three toxic chemicals, said Dr. Sakchai.   Many other patients have suffered milder symptoms and sought medical care at the outpatient ward of the hospitals, which weren’t recorded as cases related to farm chemical exposure, he said.   A long-term health impact of toxic farm chemicals received through consuming contaminated crops and the environment is also found in a form of delayed child development and faster disease progression of Parkinson's Disease said Dr. Sakchai.    “We now have between 600,000 and 700,000 births per year, from previously over one million a year. So, what will happen to the future of the nation if these children’s brain development is being impacted by toxic farm chemical contamination,” he said.    "
182,211, Digital health promises better outcomes for Thai Universal Health Coverage   Tue 06 October 2020  ,"    Digital health promises better outcomes for Thai Universal Health Coverage   Dr Sinchai Tawwuttanakidgul Assistant Secretary-General of the National Health Security Office (NHSO)   With more than 65 million Thais covered by the government's healthcare schemes, an operator of each scheme must handle with the flux of information each day — from Beneficially enrollment, health providers’ registration and claim requests, the UHC members' questions and complaints, to the staff communication at the back office.   Under this circumstance, it's inevitable for the National Health Security Office (NHSO) to integrate ""digital health"" or the use of information and Communication Technology (ICT) for health in address health needs and support the management of Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS).   When the UCS was introduced in 2002, the NHSO began developing the ICT system to replace paper-based management setup that had been used among government offices for decades.   Each year, health providers submit more than 200 million claim requests for out-patient services and seven million for in-patient service to the NHSO. The value of the claims can reach between 400 and 500 million baht in total each day.    Such a large amount of data can't be dealt with a paper-based approach that means inefficiency, slower processes, and a requirement for more administrative resources. It's not a competent method for dealing with growing demands for medical services and the specific needs of some patient groups after the launch of the UCS. Moreover, the people’s increasing access to medical services require ICT solutions for better outcomes.    Some specific population groups such as people living with HIV/AIDS require a data privacy system, in which the information of their identity and treatment should not be shared with the third party. In another case, health providers must use ICT so they can monitor the availability of medical equipment and supplies.   To manage the UCS effectively, the NHSO has integrated ICT solutions into both front and back office.   For the front office, the ICT is applied in the enrollment system, claim reimbursement, and activities relating to rights protection of the UCS members.   The enrollment system is one of the complex entities in the health system. Each Thai citizen can join only one healthcare scheme, for the time being, depending on their employment status.   For example, the children of civil servants are covered by Civil Servants Medical Benefits Scheme (CSMB). But when they reach the age of maturity, their healthcare coverage will shift to Social Security Scheme if they are employed in a formal sector, the UCS if they work in an informal sector, or the CSMB if they pursue their careers in civil services like their parents.   The changing of healthcare schemes requires the daily update through our ICT database. Moreover, individuals are born and die every day. Many people also move across cities and require medical services in their destination. These are the information that must be updated too, through linking our data to civil registration and health providers' database.   This is not just for assuring people access to healthcare in whichever their employment statuses are or wherever they live. But it is also for making health providers feeling confident that they can claim money from the right sources whenever they provide services to anyone.    ICT plays a big part in the NHSO's reimbursement system, in which health providers must fill up electronic claim forms and submit them to the NHSO via an online channel. Our audit is done online too, while the transactions are done via the banking system.  Initially, the NHSO set up a call center to allow two-way communication between our staff and the UCS members. Now we've expanded the communication channel to social media and mobile applications where the UCS members can check their eligibility, benefits package, and process their registration for health units.   At the back office, ICT has supported the NHSO staff in completing several tasks, including fund management, budget planning, and resource allocation. We also use the e-bidding system and arrange the VDO conference to link our staff from across regions. In the future, we've planned to improve our ICT system to help us manage the UCS more efficiently, timely, and accurately.   We've been looking at the ways we can use big data to improve our services. For example, we have a massive amount of information about disease prevalence and treatment outcomes obtained from health providers' claim documents collected over the years. Making use of this data will allow health providers to improve their services that solve specific health problems in local areas. The data can be used to improve the health literacy of people, while being the valuable resources for health researchers.    We've also considered Artificial Intelligence and blockchain in our ICT system. However, we will need more investment in building digital infrastructure, developing hardware, and software — which are the tasks that require collaboration across multi-sectors.  Digital health is the future trend that we can't avoid. We must work on it if we want the UCS to perform better.     "
