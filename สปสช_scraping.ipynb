The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, or COVID-19 pandemic, has become a\\nglobal threat with devastating consequences including Thailand. On this day of mention, global\\nnumbers of cumulative cases has increased to 10 million and will reach 100 million in the near\\nfuture, while worldwide dead toll has reached millions. The pandemic has proven to be a severe\\npublic health catastrophe, and is also a great testament to the role of the National Health Security\\nFund.\\nIn hindsight of this deadly viral disease, with the signs of severe epidemic, the National Health\\nSecurity Office (NHSO), as the office that manages the Gold Card Fund under supervision of the\\nNational Health Security Board (NHSB), had initiated the anticipatory care plan.

This is in accordance with the national development\\ngoal on human competency and development under the Developing\\nand Strengthening Human Capital Strategy and Social Cohesion and\\nEquity Strategy of the Twenty Year National Strategy B.E. 2561 - 2580\\n(A.D. 2018 - 2037).\\nThe Universal Health Coverage (UHC) is the health security foundation\\nfor the eligible. It increases the efficiency of healthcare’s financial\\nmanagement under the principles of “decrease suffering, increase\\nhappiness” and “the strong can strengthen the weak, the wealthy\\ncan enrich the poor.” These principles have been employed and\\ncontinuously developed for over 16 years; moreover, since 2017, the\\nNational Health Security Board has adopted the 4th Strategic Plan of\\nUniversal Coverage Scheme B.E. 2560 - 2564 (A.D. 2017 - 2021) as\\na framework for development and driving the UHC. This strategic\\nplan focuses on the vulnerable group or those who do not have\\naccess to essential healthcare services, such as the dependent elderly,\\nthe prisoners, the monks, and the underprivileged. In addition,\\nit gives special emphasis on the improvement of both the quality and\\nquantity of health services, efficient management of fiscal budget,\\nthe contribution of all stakeholders, and good governance.The key successes of the Universal Coverage I would like to express my gratitude to both\\nScheme (UCS) in 2018 were mutual cooperation, executive and staff of the Ministry of Public\\nmutual brainstorming, and mutual action among Health, other relevant ministries, the National\\nthe Ministry of Public Health, the major healthcare Health Security Office, health facilities and\\nproviders, the Office of National Health Security, hospitals from both the public and private\\nhealth management organizations, and all key sectors, health professional institutes, local\\nstrategic players for fiscal budget management governmental organizations, civil society, and\\nand to drive numerous critical activities, such other affiliated organizations in the implementation\\nas setting up Primary Care Cluster: PCC, of the government’s policies and the National\\nproviding health services for the prisoners, Health Security Board’s policies, including\\nstrengthening long term care system for the their contribution to enhance UCS. As a result,\\ndependent elderly in the community, monitoring citizens are ensured of accessible standard quality\\nand controlling the quality and standard of major of care according to their needs, and Thailand\\nhealth services, kidney replacement therapy has a sustainable health services system.\\nfor end-stage renal failure patients, increasing\\nthe accessibility and administration of essential\\nand high-cost medicines, including expanding\\ncancer screening. In addition, we have received\\ncontinuous cooperation from both the National (Clinical Prof. Emeritus\\nHealth Security Board and the Health Service Piyasakol Sakolsatayadorn,M.D.)\\nStandard and Quality Control Board in driving Minister of Public Health\\nthe UCS continuously. Chair of the National Health Security BoardA message from the Chair of the\\nHealth Service Standard and\\nQuality Control Board\\nThe Fiscal year 2018 was the third year of the four – year term that the Health Service\\nStandard and Quality Control Board (HSQCB) have been in service since February\\n2016. I can proudly say that next year, the HSQCB will complete its fourth term.\\nOver the past three years, HSQCB has accomplished its duties pursuant to Section\\n50 of the National Health Security Act B.E. 2545 (A.D. 2002), with a goal to realize\\nSection 5 of the National Health Security Act B.E. 2545 (A.D. 2002): for all citizens to\\nhave the right to receive standard and effective public health services. Certain\\nperformances are harmonized with relevant strategic plans such as the 4th Strategic\\nPlan of Universal Coverage Scheme B.E. 2560 - 2564 (A.D. 2017 - 2021), Strategy\\nNo. 2: Ensure quality and adequacy of health services, the Master Plan of Integrated\\nPreliminary Universal Health Coverage Development B.E. 2561-2564 (A.D. 2017-2021)\\nStrategy No. 1: Ensure that the eligible can access health services equally, and the\\nPatients and Personnel Safety Strategic Plan.\\nThe performance of the HSQCB has been focused on creative promotion\\nand development of service quality, including enhancing contribution from all partners\\nby promoting quality development of services in all organizations which had excellent\\nresults. In cases of unsatisfactory performances, the HSQCB has encouraged\\nimprovement of all relevant mechanisms and set up guidelines for the prevention of\\nrepetitive adverse outcomes leading to a reduction of conflicts between the providers\\nand the beneficiaries. In addition, it has been learned that the Sub-committee on\\nHealth Service Standard and Quality Control in all 13 NHSO health regions (SHSQC)\\nwere crucial mechanisms for local standard and quality control, including rights\\nprotection. SHSQC has operated by coordinating with HSQCB and other local\\nsubcommittees: the subcommittee on Provincial Petition Diagnosis for Initial Aid,\\nIndependent Unit to Receive Complaints, Coordination Center for Civil Health Security,NHSO Customer Service Center in the Service Finally, I would like to thank the HSQCB, all\\nFacility.
